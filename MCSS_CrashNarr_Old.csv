the crash occurred in October 2011 at 1630 hours in Southern California. The weather was clear and the approximate temperature was 89.1 degrees F. There was little to no measurable wind direction at the time of the collision and, the skies were clear.

The roadway was constructed of a concrete material that was found to be dry, well-worn and polished, but in good condition. The roadway in question is a multiple (8) lane freeway east/west corridor. The surrounding area is comprised mostly of commercial/residential districts. The area is also surrounded by sparse vegetation such as trees and secondary growth. There is a slight left curvature in the roadway with an approximate radius of 1,251 feet.

The crash events occurred in the number 3 and number 2 lanes of the westbound travel lanes. There are no traffic control devices regulating traffic other than a designated ?High Occupancy? section of two lanes on the left side of the westbound corridor. There are five designated westbound lanes with an average lane width of approximately (12) feet in width bordered on the right by a (10) foot wide safety lane adjacent to the shoulder. The area of the crash scene is approximately 1200 feet east of the next available off ramp allowing access to local surface streets.

The posted speed limit of both east and westbound traffic is 65 mph. The diagram provided for this case does not show the eastbound lanes of traffic. The presence of this section of the freeway did not contribute to the cause or outcome of the crash investigated.


The case vehicle was a 2009 Harley Davidson motorcycle that was being operated by a 44 year old Asian female. The rider was wearing a DOT approved motorcycle helmet and, protective upper body armored clothing at the time of the collision. She was not, however, wearing any protective lower body
 
clothing (light material business slacks) or gloves.

The MC rider of the case vehicle was travelling westbound in the number 3 lane of the freeway at a speed of approximately 65 mph. The other vehicle (OV1) was described as a blue Honda Accord and was travelling in the same direction in the number 4 westbound lane at an increased speed of about 75 mph approaching the motorcycle rider from behind and to her left side. The second other vehicle (OV2) was also travelling in the same direction in the westbound number 2 lane at a speed of about 65 mph and was either adjacent to or slightly in front of and to the right of the motorcycle rider. The second other vehicle (OV2) was described by witnesses at the scene as a red semi-tractor trailer commercial vehicle. There was no further information available on this vehicle.

As the motorcycle continued westbound, the rider suddenly observed the presence of OV1 making a sudden lane change into her lane and impacting the left side of herself and the motorcycle. The resulting impact caused the right side view mirror of OV1 to become displaced and minor damage occurred to the right front and rear doors. The OV1 continued westbound in the number 3 lane and fled the scene, failing to stop and identify or render aid to the motorcyclist.

The motorcycle rider was caught completely unaware even stating she never saw it coming. She initiated braking and swerved to the right in an attempt to avoid any further contact with the other vehicle (OV1). However, after the first other vehicle impacted with the motorcyclist, the riders ?collision avoidance?, action placed in the westbound number 2 lane at a position adjacent to the second other vehicle (OV2). During my interview with the motorcycle rider, she thought to the best of her knowledge that there was little to no contact with the second other vehicle (OV2) and, an inspection of the right side of her motorcycle revealed no visible contact damage. She did however say that her body may have contacted the truck and, at this point, she went down losing control of the bike and tumbled down the roadway surface for a distance of about 40 feet. Witnesses at the scene verified to law enforcement that there was some type of contact between the motorcyclist and the second other vehicle (OV2) and that the vehicle continued westbound failing to stop and render aid. The motorcycle rider was aided at the scene and escorted to the side of the roadway prior to the arrival of emergency service personnel. The motorcycle which had slid left side down, came to rest in the westbound number 2 lane, facing west about 40 feet ahead of the riders point of rest (POR). Those that stopped to render aid had also moved the motorcycle to the side of the roadway.
","The 44 year old female operator of the motorcycle sustained minor/moderate injuries consisting of abrasions to both unprotected hands and wrists. There were abrasions to the outer portion of the upper and lower left thigh and leg, as well as the region of the left buttocks. She also sustained bruising to the left side of the rib cage. The rider was treated at the scene by emergency service personnel and was subsequently transported to a local hospital for treatment. She was admitted to the hospital for about three days for treatment of her injuries.","The 29 year male Caucasian driver of the first other vehicle (OV1) was later identified during a law enforcement follow-up investigation. He apparently had sustained no injuries as a result of the crash and, denied any involvement. However, the damage to his vehicle was consistent with the crash scenario and statements made to law enforcement regarding the dynamics of the impact between the motorcycle and the first other vehicle (OV1). There was no information available on the identity of the driver of the second other vehicle (OV2). It is likely that based on the size of the second other vehicle and the minimal contact with the motorcyclist that he or she might not have even realized there was contact between the two-vehicles.","The 29 year old male Caucasian driver of the first other vehicle (OV1) had been driving at a speed inconsistent and greater than the regular flow of traffic. He also failed to see the motorcyclist ahead and to the right of him during the negotiation of his lane change from the number 4 lane into the number 2 westbound lanes of traffic.

The 44 year old Asian female motorcycle rider was travelling a known route from her place of employment. She was driving at a speed consistent with the regular flow of traffic at the time of the collision. Although her initial ?collision avoidance? maneuver was consistent with attempting to escape from the first other vehicle (OV1), she failed to perceive and properly react to the presence of the second other vehicle (OV2).

The driver of the second other vehicle (OV2) had been travelling at a speed consistent with the regular flow of traffic, staying within the number 2 lane and, made no apparent contribution to the cause of the crash.

The roadway was constructed of an asphalt material that was dry, worn and polished, but in good condition. There was little to no measurable wind direction at the time of the collision and, the skies were clear.

The crash occurred on a single lane freeway off ramp of a major north/south freeway corridor. The off-ramp and surrounding area is currently under construction to widen the existing off-ramp from the freeway up to adjoining surface streets. The surrounding area is comprised mostly of state owned land and commercial/residential districts. The area is also surrounded by sparse vegetation such as surrounding trees and secondary growth.

The roadway in question at the crash scene is a single northbound exit ramp accessing a major multi-phased signal controlled east west boulevard that services the area. The off ramp lane is approximately 12 feet wide bordered on both sides by concrete K-rails (Jersey Rails) and a temporary construction site for trucks and equipment. The K-Rails have also been fitted with 24 inch tall plywood panels. There is an access lane of approximately 12 feet in width
allowing construction vehicles access to the off ramp as well.

Due to the presence of on-going roadway construction, there has been a temporary posted speed limit for off ramp traffic set at 25 mph. There is also a posted traffic advisory warning motorists using this off ramp of the presence of exiting construction vehicles.

The case vehicle was a 2006 Honda Shadow VT600 motorcycle that was being operated by a 39 year-old Caucasian male. The rider was wearing a DOT approved motorcycle helmet and protective upper body armored clothing at the time of the collision.
 
The MC rider of the case vehicle was travelling northbound exiting the freeway at approximately 50 mph in proximity of the construction site with the posted 25 mph advisory. The other vehicle (OV) was travelling in the same direction having just exited the adjoin construction site on to the off ramp, accelerating to a speed of approximately 20-30 mph.

As the motorcycle continued northbound the rider suddenly observed the presence of the construction truck ahead of him travelling at a lessor speed than his approach. The motorcycle rider initiated braking and down shifting in an attempt to reduce his speed as he approach the other vehicle.

The other vehicle (OV1) was a 1995 Toyota Tacoma standard bed pick-up truck being operated by a 24 year old male Pacific Islander driver. The driver of the other vehicle (OV1) had been travelling northbound and stopped at the marked limit line prior to entering the intersection.

The driver (OV1) looked to his left; checking for any approaching eastbound traffic then moved into the intersection at a speed of 5 to 10 mph. The driver said as he moved into the intersection he looked to his right checking for any approaching westbound traffic. As he thought it was clear the driver continued forward in his vehicle traversing the eastbound lanes of the multi-lane surface street when his vehicle struck the motorcycle (MC1).
At some point the resulting impact caused the motorcycle to become engaged with the other vehicle (OV1) and pushed approximately 36 feet from the area of impact where it fell on to the right side.
Based on the location of the damage sustained it appears as though the motorcycle (MC1) had been struck on the right side by the front portion of the other vehicle (OV1).
At the time of the collision there were no other vehicles, pedestrians, animals or, environmental conditions that caused or contributed to the event.
",The 23 year old male white operator of the motorcycle (MC1) sustained non-life threatening injuries as a result of the collision.

The collision occurred during the hours of daylight in January 2012 at 0821 hours in Southern California. The weather report for 0855 hours showed overcast, calm winds and, an ambient temperature of 52.3 degrees F. Visibility at ground level was clear and unrestricted for 10 miles. The roadway surface was level, of an asphalt composition which appeared to be worn and polished otherwise in satisfactory condition.
The collision occurred on a straight multiple lane north south state highway with an overall travel-way width of 107 feet. This surface street has three lanes dedicated for northbound traffic and four lanes for southbound traffic. There is a marked 8 foot wide bicycle lane on the north side of the roadway and also a marked ?fog line? on the south side of the roadway. The posted speed limit for both north and southbound traffic is 50 mph.

The area of the crash site is about 140 feet north of an ?at grade? intersection controlled by multi-phase signal devices for all four directions of travel. There
are designated left turn lanes for all approaching traffic as well as designated right turn only lanes. The north side of the street is occupied by state protected wetlands. The south side of the street is occupied by a state owned public beach with parking.
At the location of the crash site traffic had been stopped for a southbound red light. Traffic was backed up to the area of the crash site.
The opposing lanes of traffic on this highway are separated by two sets of painted solid double yellow lines approximately 4 feet wide. The street is also bordered on both sides by a soft sandy shoulder. On the four corners of the intersection there is raised concrete curbing with concrete sidewalks. There are marked pedestrian crosswalks on the north, east and, west sides of the intersection.
There were no significant roadway grade or, crown issues with the roadway surface, in the area preceding, at or, beyond the crash site. There were no super- elevation issues with this roadway.

The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2010 Aprilia RSV4R (sport, race replica) motorcycle being operated by a 40 year old male Caucasian rider. The rider was travelling southbound at about 15 to 20 mph splitting traffic between the #1 and #2 lanes.
 
The other vehicle (OV1) was a 1996 Chevrolet 3500 flatbed utility truck being operated by a 52 year old male Caucasian driver. The driver of other vehicle (OV1) was stopped southbound in the #1 lane behind traffic.

The other vehicle (OV2) was a 1996 Chevrolet 2500 pick-up truck being operated by a 60 year old male Caucasian driver. The driver of other vehicle (OV2) was stopped southbound in the #2 lane behind traffic and, slightly ahead and adjacent to the other vehicle (OV1).

While sitting in traffic the driver of (OV1) heard something to the rear of his vehicle and was concerned that something may have fallen off the bed of the truck. He decided to check it out. As he exited his vehicle, he swung the driver side door open at the same time the motorcycle (MC1) and rider were in the process of passing. However, as the driver did this, the motorcycle impacted with the door causing the motorcycle to veer to the left impacting the right rear portion and, right side of the Chevy pick-up (OV2) ejecting the rider.

The resulting impact between the motorcycle (MC1) and the Chevy pick-up (OV2) caused the motorcycle to impact the roadway surface and slide back into the #1 lane. The rider remained on the roadway surface in proximity to the first impact site with (OV1).

At the time of the collision there were no other vehicles, pedestrians, animals or, environmental conditions that caused or contributed to the event. Although in proximity of a signal controlled intersection, the intersection and signal controls played no significant role in this event other than traffic being stopped for a red light.

M/C-1 was westbound in the #1 (outside) lane after making a right turn from a nearby side street. There was at least one slow moving vehicle in front of him that he wanted to pass. When M/C-1 made its? right turn to go west, there was another vehicle at that intersection that was making a left turn to also go west. They both made their turns at the same time and stayed in their proper lanes. It was at this time that M/C-1 wanted to pass the slower moving vehicle in the
 
#1 lane. He signaled, made a head check over his left shoulder while accelerating and changed lanes into the #2 (inside) lane. He was passing the vehicle in the #1 lane at about 30 mph. The motorcycle rider traversed the skip-dash lane lines during his passing maneuver and entered lane #2, just prior to the
collision. He was looking forward and accelerating when OV-1 came into the roadway from a driveway on the right side. Neither the M/C rider nor the OV driver could see each other because of the vehicle that was being passed in the #1 lane. The OV pulled out directly in front of the M/C who had no time to react and hit the left side of the OV, then fell to the roadway surface. Neither the rider nor the OV driver made any evasive maneuvers. There were no tire marks from either vehicle. There were only a couple of small scrapes in the roadway where the M/C hit the ground.

A witness said that the M/C and he nearly crashed when the M/C entered the road and that the M/C was going very fast. The OV was going eastbound #1 (outside/only) and making a left turn into a driveway.
According to statements, neither operator saw each other prior to impact. The rider thought that the car was pulling out from a driveway between parkedcars. Neither operator made any evasive moves. The M/C impacted the right side of the OV in the passenger door area and caused major damage to both vehicles. The rider was fully ejected and impacted the top of the door/roof line area causing damage to the helmet as well as fracturing his nose.

The collision occurred on a right curved westbound multiple lane arterial local freeway corridor (refer to CSAT image) in proximity of an interchange of two intersecting freeway corridors.

The posted speed limit is 65 mph for both freeways. It was illegal as well as unsafe to park on this freeway to obtain information regarding: super-elevation issues with this freeway surface. However, driving through this area I could find no significant roadway grade or, crown issues with the roadway surface, in the area preceding, at or, beyond the crash site.

At the location of the crash site there are no traffic control signs, signals or, fixtures to regulate the flow of traffic other than speed limit and directional signs. The diagram will not illustrate the opposing lanes of the freeway because they did not contribute to the cause or outcome of this crash.
The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2009 Harley Davidson Electra Glide (touring style) motorcycle being operated by a 50 year old male Caucasian rider. The rider was travelling westbound in the designated #1 lane of the multi-lane freeway corridor.

The collision occurred during the hours of darkness in March 2012 at 2010 hours in Southern California. Sunset was at 1751 hours. The weather report showed clear skies, with calm winds and, an ambient temperature of 63.0 degrees F. Visibility at ground level was clear and unobstructed in all directions. The roadway surface was a progressive positive grade from 0.2% grade in the area of the precipitating event to 4.0% at the motorcycles final resting place. The roadway surface was of an asphalt composition which appeared to be worn and polished otherwise in satisfactory condition.
The collision occurred on a straight uphill grade multiple lane minor arterial surface street, with an overall travel-way width of 84 feet. This is a minor arterial surface street with three lanes dedicated for westbound traffic and three lanes for eastbound traffic. There is a multi-phase signal controlled intersection (in proximity to AOI#1) that regulates the flow of north and southbound traffic from a residential area on the north to a public Park & Ride lot on the south. There are dedicated ?left turn? lanes to regulate the flow of traffic as well as a posted speed limit of 35 mph for east/west traffic. There were no super-elevation issues with this roadway. There were no significant roadway grade or, crown issues with the roadway surface, in the area preceding, at or, beyond the crash site.

At the location of the secondary crash site (AOI#2) there is a freeway on ramp of approximately 30 feet in width that grants access for westbound traffic to transition onto the northbound lanes of an interstate/freeway mainline. There are no signs or signals to regulate traffic onto this on ramp from the street.

The opposing lanes of traffic are separated by painted solid double yellow line lane markers. The intersection is also bordered on all sides by raised concrete curbs and adjoining concrete sidewalks.

The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2005 Yamaha V Star Classic (cruiser style) motorcycle being operated by a 55 year old male Hispanic rider. The rider was travelling westbound in the designated #1 lane of the multi-lane surface street entering a signal controlled intersection prior to the crash sequence.
In my conversation with the motorcycle rider he told me he was travelling a known route of travel to a meeting at his local church. He went on to tell me thatas he was driving westbound he turned his attention to a market located on the northeast corner of the intersection; he contemplated stopping in. The rider stated his speed was about 30-40 mph and there were no vehicles or anything that he could remember that would have caused him to redirect his vehicle on the roadway. The rider said he had no recollection of the crash events and, in his words: ?one minute I?m riding, the next minute I?m in the hospital!?

While inspecting the crash scene, I discovered scuff marks along the top of the curb face located on the northwest corner of the signal controlled intersection. These scuff marks appeared to coincide with scratch marks discovered on the front underside of the right foot board of the crash motorcycle. There was also damage to the underside mounting brackets for the footboard.
There were also scratch marks to the face of the exhaust pipes mounted on the right side of the bike.
The major damage to the gas tank along the top and right side coincided with the impact to the second curb face at the entrance to the freeway. What was evident at this location was the discovery of glass material, still at the scene, that matched the glass material used on the speedometer face (mounted on top of the tank) which was severely damaged.

The damage to this location of the crash motorcycle appears to suggest a high side right front collapse of the bike simultaneously onto the roadway surface and curb face.

During my scene investigation I walked the approximate 155 feet from the first area of impact to the final resting place of the motorcycle and could find no visible scratches or scuffs between the two locations suggesting a high speed wobble was created after the first harmful event that led to a high side right collapse of the motorcycle at the second harmful event.

The rider was ejected off and to the right of the second impact area however there was no indication in the police report or the riders statements as to exactly where other than inside the boundaries of the on ramp. The diagram illustrates a location for the rider as a result of the discovery of a plastic colored eye glass lens that matched the description of what the rider was wearing. This lens was discovered on the raised concrete divider in proximity to the motorcycle and possibly close to where the rider had landed.
At the time of the collision there were no other vehicles, pedestrians, animals or, environmental conditions that caused or contributed to the event. ","The 55 year old male Hispanic operator of the motorcycle (MC1) sustained serious injuries as a result of the collision. The injuries sustained were

The rider of MC-1 was proceeding northbound at approximately 44 mph, with a 21 year-old Caucasian female (no further details) passenger, directly behind him. Neither the rider or passenger was wearing a helmet and there were no passenger foot pegs.

The rider of MC-1 saw that he wouldn?t be able to negotiate the left hand curve ahead due to his high rate of speed. He applied both brakes, causing a rear wheel locked skid of approximately 106? 7?. The skid terminated at the Point of Impact (POI), where the lower right side of MC-1?s engine, impacted the lower left corner of the roll-off bin, causing severe damage to the right side of the engine. The rider and passenger of MC-1 were launched to the left, from the motorcycle onto the asphalt roadway, as the motorcycle pivoted around the corner of the bin to the left and slid to its final rest position (FRP) adjacent to the West side of the roll-off bin. The FRP of MC-1 was 8? 1? North and 3? 7? West of the POI. The rider FRP was 16? North and 11? 9? West of the POI and the FRP of the passenger was 9? 6? North and 13? 2? West of the POI.

The weather was clear with a moderate wind that was gusting and variable but predominately from the SSW. The approximate temperature was 60 degrees F. The roadway
was constructed of asphalt which was dry, worn and polished, but in otherwise good condition.

The crash occurred mid-block between signal controlled intersections. The roadway is configured in a north/south direction. The roadway has two lanes (one in each direction) with on-street parallel parking on the rider?s right and angled parking on the rider?s left. The roadway is divided with a double solid yellow painted line. The surrounding area is comprised of commercial businesses to the right and a railway easement with fencing on the left. There are trees and other greenery on both sides of the roadway. The roadway is bordered by concrete curbs and sidewalks. The roadway is a minor arterial and the speed limit is 40 mph.

MC1 was a 2007 Kawasaki ZX 10r Ninja (998 cc) sport/racing type motorcycle that was owned by the 30 year old male Caucasian rider?s father. The rider was wearing a full face helmet with integral chin bar and clear face shield. The face shield broke off during the crash and was found lying in the parking area northwest of the crash. The coroner would not allow access to the helmet. It is unknown what the color is or the safety ratings. The rider was wearing a leather jacket, motorcycle style gloves, and over the ankle sport hiking shoes.

MC1 was northbound in the #1 lane approaching traffic that was stopped. A witness in one of the stopped vehicles said that the rider weaved from side to side as he approached in what he thought was an attempt to see how to get around the stopped traffic. The rider suddenly accelerated and crossed over the
 
double yellow lines and began passing the vehicles on the wrong side of the road. At the head of the stopped vehicles was a car that was waiting to make a legal left turn into the angled parking area. This vehicle (OV1), began its? left turn at about the same time as the MC was passing the stopped traffic. The MC rider veered slightly to the right before losing control and capsizing due to a ?flopping wobble? per [name] on the MC?s left side plane and then impacted OV1 on the left side near the rear tire. OV1 was pushed in a CCW rotation approximately 1.5 feet and the MC was wedged under the OV. The rider was also pinned under the OV. Witnesses and others jacked up the OV1 to extricate the rider and the MC from under the car before emergency personnel arrived. The rider was under the OV head first. Both vehicles were in their proper orientation for their FRP?s. The MC was moved approximately 5? south of its? original FRP per the police. The OV1 driver made no pre-impact evasive maneuvers. There was a maximum reduction in wheelbase in which the front tire impacted the engine area. Accurate measurements could not be taken due to the severely damaged MC front end.

The collision occurred during daylight hours in April /2012 at 1215 hours in Southern California. The weather report showed clear skies, a SW wind direction at 8.1 mph, and an ambient temperature of 69.1 degrees F. Sunset was at 1925 hours on this day. The roadway surface was found to be dry, asphalt composition which appeared to be worn and polished otherwise in satisfactory condition. There was a measured 6.6 % downhill grade in the area of the crash site.
The collision occurred on a southbound right curve, multiple lane surface street with an overall travel-way width of 61 feet. This is a north/south residential street with two lanes dedicated for northbound traffic. There are two designated lanes for southbound traffic however, the outside #1 lane is set aside as a bike lane and is 11 feet wide.

The north and southbound lanes of this street are divided by a painted solid double yellow set of stripes spaced 12 feet apart. The width of this median varies from 12 feet wide to one set of double yellow lines at the location of the designated left turn lane.
South of the crash site there is a designated left turn lane allowing southbound traffic access westbound onto a 40 foot wide (T-Intersection) residential surface street. This street allows access to a single family housing residential tract. The residential cross street south of the crash site has a posted STOP sign for eastbound traffic accessing either north or southbound lanes on the multiple lane surface street.
At the location of the crash site there were no traffic control devices to regulate the flow of traffic in the area other than a posted electronic speed advisory sign. The speed limit on this street is 35 mph for both directions of travel. Both the east and west sides of this street are bordered by raised concrete curbs and, concrete sidewalks. There is a high angle environmental dirt bank with both low lying bushes and taller tree type vegetation on the west side of the street.

The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2006 Honda CRF250XL (off-road style) motorcycle being operated by a 20 year old male Hispanic rider. The motorcycle was not
 
set up for street legal operation. The rider was not wearing a helmet during his operation of the motorcycle or at the time of the crash event.
The rider was travelling southbound in the #1 bike lane of the multi-lane surface street approaching the residential T-intersection cross street prior to the crash event. Reports from Law Enforcement officials indicated that the rider had apparently made one pass by the speed advisory sign to check hi speed and was in the process of a second pass when the crash occurred.

As the rider continued southbound the rider came into the curve too fast and applied rear braking. This resulted in approximately 91 feet of visible rear skid marks on the roadway surface. The rider swerved to the right toward the roadway edge with the motorcycle making contact with the raised concrete curb. The motorcycle continued a short distance on the curb face eventually jumping the curb and collapsing onto the concrete sidewalk. The motorcycle continued tumbling/sliding until it collapsed back onto the surface street about 87 feet south of the first area of impact.

The rider was ejected and subsequently came to rest adjacent to the steel sign pole about 51 feet south of the first area of impact.

group. The group was riding in a staggered formation. The rider of the MC1 was to the right side of his lane. As they approached the intersection, the signal began to phase from green to yellow. OV1 was ahead of MC1 and accelerated to try and beat the signal. The rider of MC1 did the same thing when suddenly OV1 braked and turned right coming to a stop in the intersection, just beyond the crosswalk, blocking their lane. The rider of MC1 braked and veered to the right in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid colliding with OV1. MC1 impacted OV1 with the left front and side to the right side of OV1. The left hand grip broke off and the left side was damaged including the gas tank. Both MC?s fell over onto to their left side planes. The rider of MC1 broke his left ulna and radius bones at impact. He stated that he remembered jumping off his MC before the bike fell over. He stated that he landed to the left side (south of) of OV1, along with his passenger and the other rider. The rider said that when he landed in the street, he landed on his left elbow which caused an acromioclavical dislocation to his
left shoulder area. The rider said that when he braked, he thought that he may have left about 7? of rear wheel locked skid prior to impact. No skids or gouges were visible at the scene during inspection. The rider had aftermarket heavy duty crash bars on his MC because he also does stunts with the bike. There was
some pre-existing damage to MC1 which had been painted over, mostly to the top of the gas tank. There was no reduction in wheelbase.

The Other Vehicle (2006 Toyota Prius) was northbound from the stop sign, making a left turn to go westbound. The Other Vehicle driver thought the roadway was clear when she initiated her left turn. The view of on-coming traffic, in the westbound lanes is partially obscured by the trees and greenery located in the center divider, just east of her position. As the driver of the Other Vehicle initiated her left turn into the westbound #3 (inside) lane, she continued to merge to the middle lane in preparation to continue over to the #1 (curb) lane so that she could make a right turn at the next intersection which is close proximity to the crash location.

The rider detected the OV making its left turn, so he began veering to the right, in an attempt to avoid it. As the OV kept merging to the right, so did the rider. He was unable to avoid impacting OV-1 and the first impact event occurred just west of the intersection in the #2 (middle) lane. The left front of the case motorcycle impacted the right front side of the OV. The rider was fully ejected and flew over the hood of the OV, landing in the street. The M/C continued in a northwesterly direction and impacted the curb (crash event #2), causing the M.C to tumble/cartwheel (crash event #3) over the sidewalk, and down a landscaped embankment.

This is a single M/C crash in which the M/C was attempting to avoid rear-ending another vehicle that had stopped in front of him. The M/C rider was successful in the collision avoidance and came to a complete stop, however, lost his footing and the M/C fell over on its? left side plane, landing on the riders? left leg and the raised divider causing injuries. The AOI and FRP are the same. The crash occurred in Southern California In June 2012 during daylight at 1550 hours. The weather was partly cloudy and the wind was moderate out of the SSW which was a tailwind for the rider. The approximate temperature was 66.9 degrees F. The roadway surface was of asphalt material that was dry, fairly new and in good condition.

The crash occurred in a 230? long left turn lane approximately 59? south of the intersection in a single family residential area. The roadway has four through lanes (two in each direction) and a left turn lane for the rider?s direction. There is a bike lane on the opposite side of the road. On street parking is allowed on the riders? side of the road, however, per the rider, there were no cars parked there. On the riders? right side is a large open park like area with homes just beyond. The intersection near the crash site is a T type intersection that is controlled by electronic multi-phase signal control devices. The roadway in the area where the crash occurred is straight. There are a lot of greenery/trees on either side of the road with concrete sidewalks. The roadway is a North/South designation. The posted speed limit is 45 mph. and is a minor arterial.

Case Vehicle was a 2001 Big Dog Pro Sport cruiser type motorcycle that was being operated by a 42 year old Caucasian male, (5? 11?, 230 lbs.). The rider was wearing an open face full coverage M/C helmet with a clear face shield. The helmet met FMVSS-218 qualifications.

The rider was returning home and had entered the left turn lane and came to a complete, controlled stop. He was about the fourth or fifth vehicle back in his lane. There was a large truck type vehicle in front of him. The rider could see the left turn signal, which was red. The signal phased to green and traffic in all lanes for the riders? direction of travel began to proceed forward. When the truck in front of the rider had started to move forward, so did the rider. All of a
 
sudden, the truck came to a stop. The rider could not see why the truck stopped. The rider was afraid of crashing into the truck, so he swerved to his left (correct decision because of traffic moving in lanes to his right) and braked. The rider said he locked the rear tire and skidded approximately 5? in a CCW rotation before coming to a stop. There were no visible tire marks in the roadway when we examined the scene. The rider said that he ?aimed? the M/C to an area between the truck and the raised center divider. The rider was successful in coming to a complete and controlled stop without hitting anything. He then put his left foot down to stabilize the M/C. The rider either didn?t realize how close he was to the divider or misjudged the distance. His foot landed on the outside top edge of the curb high divider and slipped down to the asphalt roadway, causing him to lose his balance. The M/C fell over onto its? left side plane, landing on the divider and the riders? left lower leg, breaking his tibia and fibula. There was minor damage to the M/C consisting of scrapes. There was no reduction in wheelbase.
",The 42 year old male operator of the motorcycle sustained injuries consisting of a fractured tibia and fibula at their distal ends; severed/torn tendons in the area of the fractures; and a contusion. He was taken to a medical facility where he was treated and released. The motorcycle rider showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.,There was no OV involved. ,The 42 year old male Caucasian rider of Case Vehicle was initially following too close and/or travelling at a speed that was slightly unsafe for conditions which include a large truck in front of him that he could not see around (mobile view obstruction).,The motorcycle sustained minor left side damage consisting of small scratches. The pre-crash condition of the M/C was very good. ,There were no environmental factors determined to be contributory to the crash.

The MC then rotated in a CW direction, side-slapping the OV and then fell onto its? right side plane. The gas tank was ruptured and torn. A large piece of the left side of the gas tank was removed through the crash events. The rider was fully ejected and landed on the paved roadway surface (2nd harmful event). There was no visible evidence when we examined the scene on this late report. The officer who authored the report calculated that the MC was speeding. He used a very high coefficient of friction of .75 in his slide to stop speed calculations for the MC. This calculation puts the MC at 35.7 mph per the report. I used a more modest average of .6, and the MC speed drops to 31.7 mph. The rider of M/C-1 sustained minor injuries. There was an approximate 1.5? reduction in the wheelbase.
","The 31 year old male operator of the motorcycle sustained facial and unknown extremity lacerations along with complaint of pain to his back and hip. He was treated at the scene, and then transported to a hospital where he was treated and released. If the lacerations were to lower extremities, they could have been caused by the torn gas tank. The motorcycle rider showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.",The driver of OV-1 showed no signs of impairment and was not injured. ,"The driver of OV1 had a perception failure of not seeing the MC before making the left turn and a decision failure for the subsequent stopping in the middle of the intersection. The rider stated that if the OV had continued its? path of travel, he would have cleared the intersection and there would have been no accident. The rider was potentially exceeding the speed limit by less than 10 mph and had a reaction failure of poor avoidance maneuvers by
applying only the rear brake."," The motorcycle sustained major damage to the front and left side. The pre-crash condition of the motorcycle was good.

The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2010 Harley Davidson Wide Glide (cruiser style) motorcycle being operated by a 37 year old male Caucasian rider. The rider was wearing a motorcycle helmet of unknown make or model. The rider was, for the most part, uncooperative with law enforcement officials at the scene and, had claimed the crash occurred as a result of a former female acquaintance forcing him off the roadway.
However, this statement was disputed by at least two eye witness accounts of the rider driving at a high rate of speed prior to the crash and, the lack of any vehicles in proximity to the motorcycle.

The rider was travelling northbound in the #2 lane of the multi-lane surface street at a rate of speed. As the rider continued northbound the rider failed to navigate the right curve design of the roadway and subsequently impacted with the raised concrete median divider (left side of lane #2). The motorcycle continued northbound riding up and onto the top of the median surface for a distance of just over 100 feet.
The motorcycle continued in a northbound direction, leaving the raised median and continued tumbling/sliding into the opposing southbound lanes of traffic until it collapsed onto the loose sandy shoulder surface of the southbound side of the roadway approximately 563 feet north of the initial area of impact.

At some point the rider appeared to have impacted with the roadway surface based on witness accounts only. When contacted by law enforcement officials, the rider displayed objective symptoms of alcohol intoxication however, was not detained or arrested for driving under the influence. The rider was subsequently transported to a local hospital for treatment.
There were no other vehicles, pedestrians, animals or, environmental conditions that caused or contributed to the event.

The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2013 Lance Havana Classic (step through style) scooter being operated by a 58 year old female Caucasian rider. The rider was wearing a black HCI open face style motorcycle helmet; FMVSS218 (US DOT) approved. The helmet was retained on the riders head during the crash event and sustained no significant damage.

The rider was travelling eastbound in the #1 lane of the multi-lane surface street at 15 to 20 mph. The reduced speed was due in part to heavy traffic. As the rider continued eastbound she made a left lane change from the #1 lane to the adjacent #2 lane. Once she had negotiated this lane change she had to come to a sudden stop due to the traffic in front of her having come to a stop.

The other vehicle (OV1) a 2012 Honda CBR250 (sport race replica style) motorcycle, was being operated by a 23 year old male Caucasian who was traveling eastbound in the #1 lane to the rear and right side of MC1 at a speed of 25-35 mph. Both riders in this matter are related to each other (mother and son). The rider decided to change lanes as well, moving to the left in and behind the scooter (MC1). The rider of the other vehicle (OV1) claimed at the time he had been distracted by the local scenery and misjudged his speed and proximity to the scooter.

When the rider finally turned his attention back to the traffic in front of him, he immediately pulled in his clutch and attempted to apply both front and rear brake however, he could not stop in time and subsequently struck the rear of the scooter (MC1) causing the rider of the scooter to be ejected off the bike and onto the roadway surface.

MC had no passenger. ,2000 Harley Davidson Fat Boy (1449cc),2006 Toyota Corolla ,,"This is a MC frontal impact to the front right side of OV1 that was making a right turn from the wrong lane in front of MC1. The crash occurred on a minor arterial at a four-leg, not skewed intersection. There are four through lanes, two in each direction with dedicated left turn lanes and bicycle lanes. The intersection is controlled by electronic multi-phase signals that were working properly. The left turn lanes had a trailing green arrow when traffic activated the signal. The roadway is an east/west orientation. After impact, MC1 landed on its left side plane, front end forward and slid in a southeasterly direction to its FRP and was in an unknown orientation. The rider was fully ejected after impact and landed at an unknown location in the roadway. MC1 was eastbound in
the #2 lane. There are conflicting statements in the police report as to which lane OV1 was in. The driver and one witness said that OV1 was in the #2 lane. The rider said that OV1 was in the #1 lane. One witness was uncertain which lane OV1 was in. Based on how the accident occurred, it is very likely that OV1 was in the eastbound #1 lane. OV1 was eastbound and suddenly made a right turn to go south when the accident occurred. The driver of OV1 admitted to the police that he was distracted by his GPS system. He lives out of state and was in a rental car, indicating that he is probably not very familiar with the area. The surrounding area is comprised of commercial/retail businesses. No on-street parking is allowed. The crash took place in the #2 right lane. The crash occurred
in Southern California in July 2012 at 2119 hours. It was dark with street lights on. The weather was clear with a light variable wind. The approximate temperature was 64 degrees F. The roadway surface was of an asphalt material that was dry, worn and polished, but in otherwise good condition. The roadway has a 1.8% upgrade at the crash site with a 3.7% crown. Both sides of the roadway have 8? concrete sidewalks. The posted speed limit is 45 mph.

MC1 was a 2000 Harley Davidson Fat Boy cruising type motorcycle that was being operated by a 41 year old Caucasian male, (5?10?/200 lbs.). The rider was wearing an unknown style helmet with unknown ratings.

MC1 was eastbound in the #2 (right) lane at about the posted speed limit. Traffic was moderate. The rider said that OV1 was in the left lane and ahead of him, when suddenly, OV1 made a right turn in front of him without signaling. The rider said that he braked, and tried to steer right, but could not avoid colliding with OV1. The driver of OV1, a 21 year old male Caucasian (5? 10?/170 lbs.) said that he was looking at his GPS unit for directions when he realized that he needed
 
to turn right to go home. He said he was in the #2 lane. He said that when he made his right turn, he was hit on the right side. Neither vehicle left any pre- impact tire marks in the roadway. Based on the lane widths, vehicle speeds, and crash dynamics, it is unrealistic to believe that OV1 was in the same lane as MC1 making a right turn and causing the crash. When looking at where the First Harmful event (POI) is plotted by the police, it appears that OV1 was originally in the left lane and then made its right turn. The police found the driver of OV1 at fault for the crash for making an unsafe turning movement. The left side of the front forks, near the axle bolts, broke as a result of the impact with OV1, but there was no reduction in wheelbase. Both the tank and cap were fully retained on MC1.

The weather report for 1055 hours showed mostly cloudy skies, winds out of the SSW at 9.2 mph and, an ambient temperature of 70.9 degrees F. Visibility at ground level was 10.0 miles. The roadway surface was dry, level, of an asphalt composition which appeared to be worn and polished otherwise in satisfactory condition.

The collision occurred at an at-grade intersection of two straight multiple lane surface streets. The north/south surface street is a principal arterial with three lanes dedicated for north and three lanes dedicated for southbound traffic. There are also (leading signal) dedicated left turn lanes for north to westbound traffic and, south to eastbound traffic. There are no designated right turn lanes or bike lanes for either north or southbound traffic. The opposing lanes of traffic are separated by an 8 inch tall and ten foot wide raised concrete and brick median. The posted speed limit is 45 mph for both directions of travel.

There are (leading signal) designated left turn lanes for west to southbound traffic and, east to northbound traffic. There are no designated right turn lanes however, there are dedicated bike lanes for both directions of travel east and west of the intersection. The opposing lanes are separated by a painted solid double yellow line. The posted speed limit for east/west traffic is 40 mph.

Both streets are regulated by multi-phase overhead traffic signals. There were no significant roadway grade or, crown issues with the roadway surface, in the area preceding, at or, beyond the crash site, as well as any super-elevation issues.

The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2008 Triumph Thruxton (Sport race, replica type) motorcycle being operated by a 41 year old male Caucasian rider. The rider had initially been stopped for traffic in the designated left turn lane for north to westbound traffic at the intersection. The rider was waiting behind another utility truck which was not involved in the crash event.

The other vehicle (OV1) was a 2007 Toyota Tacoma standard bed pick-up truck being operated by a 17 year old male Caucasian juvenile. The driver of the other vehicle (OV1) was travelling southbound and setting up to turn right.

When the rider received a green light he moved forward into the intersection and maintained an approximate speed of 15 mph (22 fps) through the intersection. At about the same time, the other vehicle driver (OV1) initiated his right turn movement at a high rate of speed.

As the rider approached the westbound lanes of the cross street, the other vehicle (OV1) was slightly ahead of him and continuing at a high rate of speed. The rider suddenly observed a metal and plastic constructed chair spill out of the rear utility bed of OV1.

When I interviewed the rider he seemed to think the chair spilled out of OV1 and first bounced off the vehicle in front of him however it ended up directly in front of him. The rider went on to tell me the chair landed on the back upright with the seat portion facing up.
The rider said as the front of his motorcycle impacted with the chair, the front wheel became entangled and he effectively lost any ability to steer or use his front brake. The rider tried to steer and use his brake however, to no avail and simply rode it out until the motorcycle collapsed onto the roadway surface in a low side left impact. The rider stayed with the motorcycle as it slid up to and stopped near the north curb line of the westbound portion of the roadway.

There was no contact between the motorcycle (MC1) and the other vehicle (OV1); only the spilled cargo (chair) from the rear utility bed of OV1.
At the time of the collision there were no other vehicles, pedestrians, animals or, environmental conditions that caused or contributed to the event.

The rider was fully ejected during the first harmful event and sustained major injuries. The MC went down on its right side after impact and was facing in a northwesterly direction. The crash occurred in Southern California in July 2012 during hours of daylight at 0700 hours. The weather was clear with no wind. The approximate temperature was 59 degrees F. The roadway surface was concrete, which was dry, worn and polished. It has several transverse tar snake repairs for cracks
but was in otherwise good condition.

The crash occurred mid-block on a two lane roadway that is separated by a double solid yellow line. Each lane is 11? wide. There are bike lanes on either side of the road. On the right side of the road is a 5? dirt shoulder. There are utility poles and some trees. At the right edge of the dirt shoulder there is an approximate 20? drop down to railroad tracks. There is no guardrail or fence. Beyond the railroad tracks is a park with soccer fields. On the left side of the road is a chain link type fence and no shoulder. There is an approximate 15? easement full of tall weeds and then a freeway wall. There are no curbs. The roadway at the crash scene is curved to the left and has a slight upgrade for the MC?s direction of travel. The roadway runs in a north/south configuration. The posted speed limit is 40 mph.

The MC was southbound in the #1 lane. Traffic was light. OV1 was southbound ahead of the MC. The MC was riding with a friend in a single file style formation and was the lead bike. The OV driver was not familiar with the area; was lost; and was exceeding the speed limit. When she realized that she had missed the
 
side street that she was supposed to turn onto, she slowed and moved to the right edge of the roadway. She checked for traffic in her mirrors and saw a MC that was far enough away that she felt she had enough time and room to make a left U-turn. The MC that she saw was the friend of the Case MC. The Case MC was much closer and possibly in her blind spot. As the Case MC rider saw the OV pull over to the right and slow down, he saw its brake lights and let off on his throttle, slowing from approximately 40 mph to about 35 mph. He also moved from the center of the lane to the left side of the lane, but never applied his brakes. The OV made a left turn in front of the case MC and was blocking the roadway. The rider said that he thinks he may have steered left a little, but did no other avoidance maneuvers. He said that his natural reaction was to do what he does when riding in the dirt and about to hit something, which is to stand up on the foot pegs to help absorb the shock. The rider said he remembers impacting the OV near the leading edge of the driver?s door and then flying over the roof of the OV and landing in the street to an unknown distance from the 1st harmful event. The MC proceeded down the road approximately 88? 09? in an unknown dynamics, landing on its right side plane facing in a northwestern direction against the chain link fence.

The crash occurred at a four-leg, not skewed intersection. There are five through lanes and dedicated left turn lanes for three of the four legs. The fourth leg is a driveway to a small shopping center. The roadway has a north/south dedication, however, at the crash site; the roadway has an east/west orientation. The MC slid on its right side plane, front end forward, and impacted the center rear of the OV (2nd harmful event), pushing it forward approximately 5?. The rider was fully ejected when the MC went down. The MC landed on his right leg, causing his injuries. The rider landed about half way (approximately 6?) from the 1st harmful event (out of control lay down) and the 2nd harmful event (MC impacting OV). All events occurred in the #2 middle lane. The MC was facing in a southeasterly orientation at its FRP. The crash occurred in Southern California in August 2012 during hours of daylight at 1810 hours. The weather was clear with a moderate wind from the south. The approximate temperature was 79 degrees F. The sun was low in the horizon and behind both operators, but had not set. The roadway surface was of an asphalt material that was dry, worn and polished, but in otherwise good condition. The roadway has a 6.1% downgrade at the crash site.

The crash occurred just prior to the intersection. On the rider?s right side of the intersection, is the fourth leg of the intersection (driveway) leading to the commercial complex. There are commercial/retail businesses on either side of the roadway. It has four through lanes prior to the crash site and expands to five lanes after at the crash site. There are eight lanes on the opposite side of the intersection. The roadway is divided by painted double yellow lines.

The case MC was southbound in the #2 lane at about the posted speed limit. Traffic was moderate. The rider said that he was attentive and not distracted when he noticed that he was approaching the intersection with a red light and a car stopped in his lane. He panic braked. He applied too much front brake, locking the front tire, causing the forks to turn and the bike to go down. The driver of the OV admitted that he stopped quickly because he was not paying attention. The OV, however, was stopped at the time of the crash. The driver of the OV took some photos of the crash scene which are in the case file. Based on the OV driver?s photos, the MC left approximately 12? of scrapes from the 1st harmful event to its FRP at the 2nd harmful event. It is unknown if the MC rotated lightly in a CW rotation during the slide (1st harmful event) or after impacting the OV (2nd harmful event). Based on the damage to the front fender and the scrapes in the photograph, it appears that the MC may have done both. The MC was sliding on its right side plane, front end forward, and being protected by the crash bars that were installed both to the front and rear. The sliding damage was minimal and only to the crash bars on the right side. The damage to the front fender and left side of the MC was from impacting the OV. There was no evidence of any skid from the MC on the roadway or the tires. There was no reduction in wheelbase.

It occurred on a major non-freeway arterial that is close to the freeway and next to an urban high school and a senior living complex. The roadway has a north/south designation. In the area of the crash, the roadway has a northwest/southeast orientation. The roadway in the southbound lanes reduces from two lanes to one and has a left curve. The number one (left lane) is eliminated and forced to merge right with the number two lane. The crash occurred approximately 600? south of the intersection, and beyond the merge markings in the only lane that is marked. This single lane was measured at 18? wide. There are bike lanes and concrete sidewalks on both sides of the roadway. There is a painted divider made up of double yellow lines that is 14? wide. The northbound side has two lanes that open up to four lanes at the intersection. No on-street parking is allowed on either side of the roadway. The asphalt roadway was travel worn and polished, but in very good condition with no evidence of any repair work or the need for any. The crash occurred in Southern California in September 2012 at 1300 hrs. with clear skies and a moderate wind from the north. The approximate temperature was 85 degrees F. The posted speed limit is 45 mph. The roadway has a 2.2% downgrade and 0.0% crown for the MC1 at the crash site

The Case Vehicle was a 2004 Yamaha V-Star cruising type motorcycle that was being operated by a 69 year old Caucasian male, (6?00?/210 lbs.). The rider was wearing a partial coverage helmet with a visor and prescription sunglasses. The helmet is rated to FMVSS 218 (US-DOT) standards.

MC1 was southbound in the #1 (left) lane at about 20-30 mph. and slowing by reducing the throttle. His lane was diminishing and he needed to merge to the right. Traffic was heavy with stop and go movement. The rider said that he was passing vehicles on the left and never saw any movement from the vehicle that hit him (OV1). In the police report, he told the police that he saw OV1 starting to turn into his area of travel and that he attempted to swerve left. He said that OV1 impacted the right rear side of the MC (1st Harmful Event), causing damage to the saddle bag and forcing the MC into an out of control CW rotation. The
 
MC high sided and fully ejected the rider, vaulting him above ride height and over the handlebars, breaking the windscreen, then sliding on the paved roadway surface (2nd Harmful Event). The MC slid on its left side plane, high side forward, and impacted OV2 (3rd Harmful Event) to the front left side before coming to rest in the center divider area. The rider sustained contusions to his chest and right thigh, probably as he was ejected from the MC and struck the windscreen and handlebars. He also sustained abrasions from impacting and sliding on the paved roadway surface. The rider slid in the prone position causing abrasions to his elbows and knees. OV1 fled the scene. There was not enough information regarding OV1 for the police to attempt any follow-up. This was a Late Report (19 days). We were unable to reach the rider for several more days. When we inspected the scene, there was no visible evidence. The police report did not record any of the physical evidence. The rider provided some crash scene photos that were included with the report. They show the MC at its? FRP, however there is no good reference point for actual placement. The photos also show an estimated 30? scrape mark from the MC leading to its FRP. A portion of the mark is covered by OV2 that moved to the center divider after the crash. The police report only gives an estimated AOI and makes no mention of the scrape or FRP. There was no reduction in wheelbase for the MC.
","The 69 year old male operator of the motorcycle sustained contusions and abrasions to his chest, abdomen, elbows, and knees. He was treated at the scene, and then went to a walk in clinic later for additional treatment. The motorcycle rider showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.","The status of the driver of OV1 is unknown because he/she fled the scene. Based on the dynamics of the crash itself, it is assumed that this driver sustained no injuries. The driver of OV2 showed no signs of impairment and was not injured.", The unknown driver of OV1 was attempting to make an unsafe lane turning maneuver to try and pass vehicles on the left and did not see the MC. The MC rider should have merged into the traffic lane instead of continuing to pass vehicles on the left in the wide lane at the speed he was going,"The motorcycle sustained minor damage to the front fender, windscreen, and both sides. The MC had already been repaired prior to our inspection. The rider provided photos of the damaged MC and still had some of the damaged parts. The pre-crash condition of the motorcycle was very good.

","2006 Nissan Murano, Non-contact.",,"This single motorcycle crash occurred on Tuesday in September 2012 at 0956 hours in Southern California. The temperature was 73 degrees F and it was clear with no precipitation. The winds were variable at 3.2 mph and the asphalt roadway surface was dry and in good repair.

The crash occurred on an undivided North/South, city street, which is the top of a tee intersection bordered by 8 in. raised concrete curbs, in a residential apartment area. The street is level, with a 4.9 % crown with one 20 ft. wide travel lane in each direction separated by a yellow dashed center line. The posted speed limit is 35 mph and there are no traffic controls.
MC1 is a 2004 Yamaha YZFR6, 599cc, Sport Motorcycle, with 28,078 miles on the odometer, was being operated by a 21 year old Hispanic male (5 ft. 9 in., 190 lbs.) who was wearing a full face helmet with a smoke colored face shield at the time of the crash. OV1 (a non-contact vehicle) is a 2006 Nissan Murano, being operated by a 45 year old Hispanic female (5 ft. 4 in., 150 lbs.) who was wearing the available three-point manual lap and shoulder
restraint. MC1 was behind OV1 approaching the east/west intersection on the right, both vehicles were southbound. OV1 was positioned to the right of the travel lane, slowing as it approached the intersection, and there was no indication that her turn signals were being used. MC1 attempted to pass OV1 to the left, believing she was going to turn right at the intersection. As MC1 came adjacent with the rear of OV1, OV1 started making a left turn into a private driveway into an apartment complex. MC1 attempted to avoid hitting OV1 by swerving to the left and braking. This caused the handlebars to rotate clockwise, hitting the right side of the gas tank, breaking the right hand throttle/grip off and causing the motorcycle to low slide out onto its left side 7? north of the north curb line and 18? west of the east curb line. There was no contact with OV1. The driver of OV1, completed her left turn into the parking lot and stopped, and she was told by a witness of MC1 and its rider.
","The 21 year old male rider of the motorcycle sustained bilateral anterior contusions to the palms of both hands, an abrasion to his right knee, a laceration to his left knee and a contusion to the top of his right foot.",,"The rider of MC1 didn?t allow enough distance between MC1 and OV1. This coupled with a higher speed than was prudent for conditions, caused the rider of MC1 to apply excessive braking, which caused a low side laydown. The driver of OV1 failed to signal for her left turn and wasn?t adjacent to the center lane line.",There were no pre-existing vehicle condition that contributed to the accident. ,There were no contributing environmental factors.
A0144,144,Motorcycle (MC1) out of control high speed lay-down event. MC had no passenger. ,2000 Honda CBR 600 F4 (599cc) sport/racing style,,,"This is a single MC lay down event in which the rider lost control after landing from a stated 60 mph. wheelie. The crash occurred in September 2012 at 0951 hours on an east/west five lane roadway, 145? west of a four-leg, non-skewed intersection that has posted stop signs for the north/south cross street. The rider was traveling at approximately 246 degrees from North in a westbound direction. The weather was partly cloudy with no wind. The temperature was approximately 76 degrees F. The roadway is a local road that is heavily traveled and bisects a single family residential area. The posted speed limit is 45 mph. The asphalt roadway was dry, worn and polished with cracks and raised ridges, and in overall poor condition in the crash area. The defects run longitudinal and transverse and are present in all lanes of travel. The roadway prior to and after the crash area is in better condition. The roadway is straight and level with a 3.5% crown at the crash site. There are sidewalks, trees, and block walls on both sides of the roadway. There is no on-street parking allowed. The rider was wearing a full face MC helmet. The only other safety apparel worn was a pair of armored gloves. The rider stated that when he landed his front tire back onto the roadway, it hit one of the raised ridges in the roadway causing the MC to go into high speed wobble that he referred to as a ?tank slapper? in which the handlebars violently swing back and forth to their maximum turning radius. The rider could not estimate how long this event lasted before the MC flipped over and fully ejected him.

The Case Vehicle was a 2000 Honda CBR 600 F4 sport/racing style motorcycle that was being operated by a 20 year old male, (5? 11?/170 lbs.). The rider was wearing a full face with integral chin bar with a gray/smoke tinted face shield. The helmet is rated to FMVSS 218/DOT and Snell M2010 standards.

The case MC was westbound in the #2 (inside) lane at about the posted speed limit in second gear. Traffic was light to moderate. The rider said that he was attentive and not distracted. He then decided to rapidly accelerate and raise the front tire off the ground. In doing so, he said that he attained the speed of approximately 60 mph. when he began to red line on the RPMs. He then had to slow down and put the front tire back onto the roadway. In doing so, the front tire landed on a ridge in the roadway which caused the MC to lose control (first harmful event). The ridge that was located at the marked area of impact in the police report runs transverse and is about one inch in height. The MC flipped and tumbled down the roadway in an unknown dynamic. The MC had damage to
 
all sides, including the top/seat area. Prior to the crash while the MC was in the high speed wobble, the rider said that he tried to accelerate again and raise the front tire off the ground in an attempt to regain control. When the MC flipped, the rider was fully ejected and slid mostly on his back. He was wearing a back pack with a change of clothes inside. The back pack was destroyed from sliding on the roadway surface, but protected the rider from sustaining some injuries. The laceration that the rider sustained on his chin was possibly caused by the windscreen as the rider was ejected. The rider told the police that there was a vehicle in front of him that had slowed down. He applied his front brake, causing it to lock and he lost control and crashed. One scrape was located at the scene. It was about 18? long. It was found in the painted center divider area and was very faint. I could not determine whether or not it was made from the crash MC based on its location, which was approximately 15? west of the first harmful event. There were no other supporting scrapes/gouges to help in determining the path of the MC after falling onto the roadway. The scrape was photographed, but not included in the diagram. There was no reduction in wheelbase.
","The 20 year old male operator of the motorcycle sustained a minor laceration to his chin, and minor abrasions to his elbows, the left hip/buttocks area, and right knee. He was treated at the scene, and then transported to a hospital where he was treated and released. The motorcycle rider showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.",There was no OV involved. ,The 20 year old male rider of the MC1 had a decision failure by choosing to ride in an unsafe and aggressive manner. He had a reaction failure due to his speed.,"The motorcycle sustained major damage to all sides, including the seat. The pre-crash condition of the motorcycle was fair. It is not equipped with ABS brakes, which most likely would not have helped prevent the crash. The exhaust system was an after-market type that is a high performance style with excessive noise. It had been modified to make even more noise by drilling out internal parts and making more vents for the exhaust to escape (see photos # MC023 and MC027).","The poor condition of the roadway could be a contributing factor based only on the riders statements as to how the crash occurred. In a normal riding manner, the roadway would most likely not cause a crash."

MC had no passenger. ,2005 Buell XB 12 S (1203cc),2011 Jeep Wrangler ,,"This is a MC right-frontal impact to the left rear corner of OV1 that was stopped for another vehicle ahead. The non-contacted vehicle was making a right turn into a driveway. The crash occurred on a non-freeway principal arterial just west of a three-leg, not skewed driveway type intersection. There are five through lanes; two in each direction with a continuous two-way left turn center lane. The roadway has an east/west dedication with a slight left curve at the crash site. The MC was headed east with an approximate 44 degrees compass heading. The rider stated he was going about 20 mph and in 3rd gear and was about to down-shift when suddenly traffic in front of him stopped. The rider made unsuccessful collision avoidance maneuvers. After impact, the MC landed on its
left side plane, front tire forward in an easterly direction and impacted OV1. The rider was fully ejected when the MC went to the ground. The rider said that he jumped off the MC then tumbled/rolled approximately 20? and landed on his feet like a gymnast. The rider also said that he never hit the OV and that the
crash was a low side wash-out due too excessive braking and the recently paved roadway surface that was slick with oil from the asphalt mixture. The surrounding area is commercial/retail on both sides of the road. The crash took place in the #2 (right) lane. The crash occurred in Southern California in September 2012 during hours of daylight at 1420 hours. The weather was clear with a light wind from the SSW giving the rider a slight tailwind. The approximate temperature was 70 degrees F. The roadway surface was of an asphalt material that was dry and recently paved. The roadway has a 0.8% upgrade and a 1.9% crown at the crash site. Both sides of the roadway have 5? concrete sidewalks, trees, and street light poles. The posted speed limit is 40 mph.

The Case Vehicle was a 2005 Buell sport/racing type motorcycle that was being operated by a 50 year old male, (5?03?/120 lbs.). The rider was wearing a full face motorcycle helmet with an integral chin bar and clear face shield. The helmet is rated to FMVSS 218 (US DOT) and Snell M2010 standards. The rider was also wearing MC style glove and boots.

The case MC was eastbound in the #2 (right) lane at about 30 mph. and in 3rd gear. Traffic was heavy, but moving. The rider saw that the signal ahead was
 
green and that overall, the traffic was flowing. He did not see the vehicle one ahead of the OV that was being driven by a 44 year old female (5?04?/125 lbs.) that was slowing to make a right turn into a driveway which caused traffic to stop. The rider said he applied too much front brake, causing the wheel to lock up and start to skid. He said that he released the front brake before losing control and then applied the rear brake, with the same result. He released the rear brake and decided to attempt to split lanes to avoid rear-ending the OV. The rider said that another vehicle that was in the #1 lane had drifted a little to the right, closing the gap for him to be able to lane split. It appears that the rider used poor braking techniques (locking the brakes) and due to the fresh, oily asphalt he lost control in his attempt to swerve and lane split and impacted the left rear of OV1 with the right handlebar, causing MC1 to go down. After impact, the rider jumped/was ejected off the MC and rolled/tumbled to his feet. This was a Late Report (7 days). There was no physical evidence at the crash site when the police where there per the police report. We found no evidence when we inspected the scene. There was no reduction in wheelbase.

The crash occurred at a ?T? type, not skewed intersection with a through street and a cul-de-sac on which the rider resides. Both streets are posted at 25 mph. and are non-freeway local or collector streets. Traffic was light. The cul-de-sac is an unmarked two lane roadway that runs in an east/west direction. The collector road runs in a north/south direction and has two through lanes (one in each direction) and a dedicated left turn lane on the northbound side. Both roadways are straight. Block walls, trees, and two story apartment buildings are permanent visual obstructions. Both roadways have standard 8? curbs with greenery and sidewalks, except for the east side of the northbound road. It has a curb and greenery which hides a concrete barrier that supports a metal fence along a railway easement. There is no sidewalk. The only signal control is a stop sign for eastbound traffic. The rider had just left his residence and was traveling eastbound at a high rate of speed. After seeing OV1, the rider said that he locked both brakes and lost control, causing the MC to wash out and land on its right side plane. The MC deposited 23 feet of front wheel skid before falling onto the roadway. The MC then slid another 87 feet before impacting the left side of OV1.

It sustained a minor abrasion on the right side of the chin bar.
 
MC1 was eastbound in the #1 lane when OV1 entered the intersection to make its left turn. Due to the buildings and block wall, cross traffic cannot be seen from mid-block until they are in the intersection. At the point where the tire marks start, OV1 would not be visible unless he had already entered the intersection. The rider over-braked and lost control then slid into OV1. MC1 was equipped with heavy duty aftermarket crash bars and engine guards (sliders) that are made of nylon which prevented additional damage. When MC1 went down, it left very little evidence on the roadway. When MC1 impacted OV1 with the front end, the forks collapsed rearward. The front tire impacted the radiator and exhaust causing damage. Both damaged parts appeared to still be operational. When we inspected MC1, the rider had already dismantled most of the damaged parts. He still had possession of the damaged parts.
Photographs were taken of these parts. The front forks are bent, and one is broken. Even though the front sliders and crash bars were removed, the crash bars and rear sliders still were able to provide directional information of MC1?s path.

The rider was also wearing a motorcycle oriented heavy leather jacket and gloves.
 
MC1 was eastbound in the #1 lane at an unknown speed, but presumed to be excessive based on statements from witnesses and the damage to both vehicles. The driver of OV1 said that when eastbound traffic cleared, he started making his left turn when he saw a jogger headed westbound on the south side sidewalk who was about ready continue across the street. There was also a stopped vehicle at the northbound stop sign with its left turn signal on. The driver of OV1 then slowed, nearly stopping, at which time he looked back for on-coming eastbound traffic. He stated that he saw MC1 and was almost simultaneously impacted by MC1. The driver of OV1 said that he then drove to the southwest corner and parked his truck, then ran back into the street to check on the rider. The rider was non-responsive. MC1 was approximately 10? north of the POI on its left side plane facing southeast. The rider was
approximately 10? southwest of MC1. The front tire was flat from the impact which broke the front rim. The forks were also broken. The gas tank has a dent on the right side that appears to have been made by the handlebars after the initial impact caused the forks turn to the right. The right side of the handlebars impacted the gas tank, breaking the throttle/hand grip off. MC1 was found to be in 3rd gear. There were no pre-impact tire marks from either vehicle.

There was additional minor damage to the right side after a side- slap occurred. There was very minor damage to the left side of MC1 consisting of scratches after MC1 fell onto its? left side plane. The windshield was broken, probably when the rider was ejected and flew over the handlebars. There was evidence that the front tire made contact with the radiator. A static measurement for the reduction in wheelbase was not possible because the front tire and fork assembly were broken. The pre-crash condition would be labeled as new or near new.

OV1 sustained moderate to major damage to the right side starting at the right front fender and moving through the door and rear cab area, then ending a short distance beyond the forward corner of the truck bed. The roof line was dented. The metal running board step was also severely deformed. Only the right side mirror had been replaced when OV1 was inspected. Its pre-crash condition would be labeled as good.","The roadway design is a major contributing factor in crash causation. The 30? offset creates permanent view obstructions for both directions of travel involving a westbound left turning vehicle.

MC1 was 2002 Honda CBR 600 F4i sport/racing type motorcycle that was being operated by a 41 year old male (5? 09?/157 lbs.). The rider told the police that he was on his way home from work and had no memory of the crash. He was wearing an unknown style helmet with unknown safety ratings.

MC1 was westbound in the # 1 lane at about the speed limit of 35 mph. and had just completed negotiating a left curve. For unknown reasons, the rider began
 
heavy braking with his rear brake, lost control and crashed. The tires had very low air pressure upon inspection 3 days after the crash (17 psi front/08 psi rear). There was no obvious or visible reason for the low psi. The low tire pressure would cause a lack of control, especially while negotiating a curve at 35 mph. It would cause the MC to go wide through the turn and hinder handling and braking. It appears that the rider did go wide right though the left curve and was unable to safely recover to the middle of his lane. He began to brake heavily, lost control, and high-sided on the MC?s right side plane. The rider was fully ejected and skidded/slid on the roadway causing abrasions to his hands. He then slid into a 4x3x4? decorative rock mailbox which was adjacent to the right curb, and came to rest in the flowers/bushes. It is unknown whether the impact with the roadway surface or the rock mailbox caused the riders additional injuries, or a combination of both. MC1 continued skidding/sliding on its right side plane, rotating slightly in a CCW direction until it impacted the left rear corner of OV1. MC1 then rotated 180 degrees from its original direction and came to rest middle of the roadway, near OV1. According to the PAR, MC1 left approximately 25? of rear tire lock skid marks. MC1 skidded/slid approximately 63? to its FRP, including impacting OV1 near the end of the slide. MC1 was towed and the rider taken to a hospital. OV1 was left parked at the scene.","The 41 year old male operator of MC1 sustained moderate injuries consisting of traumatic brain injury (NFS), a fractured clavicle, and abrasions to both hands. It is unknown what if any protective gear the rider was wearing. The rider of MC1 showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.",,The rider of MC1 made a decision failure in riding a MC that was not properly maintained. He was also riding too fast based on the condition of the MC.," MC1 sustained moderate damage mostly to the right side as a result of impacting the roadway and sliding, as well as impacting OV1. The low tire pressures, combined with too much speed, are primary crash causation factors. MC1 had evidence of at least one prior crash in which it was down on the left side. The fairing was held together near the top with a plastic ?zip? tie. There was no reduction in wheelbase. The pre-crash condition would be labeled as fair to good.

OV1 was not inspected. The extent of damage is listed in the PAR as minor to the left rear corner. The pre-crash condition of OV1 is unknown.","The numerous switch-back type turns, a severe grade, and a high speed limit for the roadway are all considered contributing factors to this crash."
A0235,235,"This was a motorcycle (MC1) vs. another vehicle (OV1), front to side impact collision with a secondary lay-down event that caused the motorcycle to impact the roadway surface.

There were no passengers on this motorcycle at the time of the collision.","1997 Harley Davidson FLSTS Springer Heritage (cruiser) 1338cc, white Other Vehicle (OV1):",2006 Saturn automobile sedan (black),,"This was a front to side impact crash event resulting in minor injuries to the motorcycle rider. The collision occurred at 1814 hours on Wednesday, June 2013 in Southern California. The weather report showed clear skies, WSW winds at 5.8 mph, and an ambient temperature of +54.0 degrees F. The roadway surface was found to be dry, level, of an asphalt composition which appeared to be worn and polished otherwise in satisfactory condition. Sunrise was at 0646 hours and Sunset at 2007 hours.
The collision occurred on a straight two lane local street with an overall travel-way width of 36 feet. The roadway runs north and south with one lane dedicated for each direction of travel. The opposing lanes on this street are separated by one set of painted solid double yellow lines and there are no
designated turn lanes present in the area of the crash site. The crash precipitated within the southbound lane of traffic. The east side of the street is occupied by commercial businesses and the west side is a local railroad easement for both north and southbound commercial rail service. The street is bordered on both sides by raised concrete curbs. The east side of the street does not allow for the parallel parking of vehicles and there is a 5 foot wide public sidewalk available for pedestrians. The west side of the street has a 9 foot wide set-back for parallel parking and there are no
sidewalks available. There is a +0.2% grade for southbound traffic and +3.4% crown in the area of the crash site. There are no other issues with the roadway surface, in the area preceding, at or, beyond the crash site.

MC1 was a 1997 Harley Davidson FLSTS (cruiser) motorcycle being operated by a 62 year old male rider. The rider was wearing a motorcycle helmet of unknown make model or rating.
The rider was travelling southbound approaching OV1 at an unknown rate of speed. The rider had positioned his motorcycle near the center portion of the roadway with the intent of passing OV1 on the left. OV1 was travelling at a lessor speed and the rider proceeded to initiate his passing movement.
OV1 was a 2006 Saturn automobile being operated by a 48 year old female driver. The driver of OV1 was slowing down for the purpose of negotiating a U-Turn type movement from her present southbound direction to northbound.
 
The driver of OV1 decided to facilitate her U-turn movement in proximity to a 38 foot wide driveway along the west side of the street in case she needed more turning area. She also swung wide to the right side of the roadway to give herself more room.
As OV1 moved left crossing over the double yellow lines the rider of MC1 had moved out of the southbound lane to an area just inside the northbound lane adjacent to the double yellow lane lines. The driver of OV1 did not see MC1 and the rider prior to impact and the motorcycle subsequently struck the left side of
OV1 near the left rear quarter panel.
The rider of MC1 had insufficient time in order to initiate a collision avoidance maneuver. During an inspection of the crash scene there was no evidence of front or rear tire braking from MC1, only scrape marks where it had collapsed onto the roadway surface. The resulting impact caused the motorcycle to collapse left side down. The rider fell off of his motorcycle and onto the roadway surface.
At the time of the collision there were no other vehicles, pedestrians, animals or, environmental conditions that caused or contributed to the event.",The 62 year old male rider of MC1 sustained non-life threatening injuries as a result of the collision. The injuries sustained were abrasions to both elbows. During the police investigation officers noticed the presence of alcohol on the rider. While at the hospital the rider was arrested for driving under the influence. A sample of his blood was taken about 1hour and 30 minutes after the accident. Results indicated a .11 BAC at the time of the blood draw.,The 48 year old female driver of OV1 sustained no injuries as a result of the collision. There were no apparent objective symptoms of alcohol intoxication.,"The 62 year old male rider of MC1 was operating a vehicle on a public roadway while under the influence of an intoxicant. Furthermore he was initiating an unsafe passing movement to the left of OV1.
The 48 year old female driver of OV1 contributed to the crash event by initiating an unsafe U-turn movement in proximity to approaching traffic.","MC1 sustained minor front end and right side damage to the area of the front fender. The right front brake handle was also broken. MC1 appeared to have been in satisfactory operating condition prior to the crash event.
OV1 sustained minor left side damage was in satisfactory operating condition.",There were no environmental factors that were determined to have contributed to the cause or outcome of this crash event.

It was daylight with scattered clouds, the temperature was approximately 71 degrees F. and the winds were SSW at approximately 13 mph. The asphalt roadway surface was dry, noted to be travel worn and there was light traffic.

The crash occurred at a 4 way signal controlled intersection on a straight, north/south road that has a 4.0% positive grade in the direction of travel. There are 2 north/south through lanes, with a northbound left turn lane; southbound has a left and right turn lanes. Westbound is a residential road without lane markings that is 24 ft. wide with brick walls at the edge of the travel surface and a 5.1% negative grade in the direction of travel. Where the roads intersect the grade increases to a negative 12.0%. The west side of the intersection wasn?t involved with this crash.
MC1 is a 2002 Harley Davidson FXDX (1449cc) motorcycle with high rise handlebars, ridden by a 23 year old male (6 ft. and 185 lbs.) without
an M1 endorsement. The rider was wearing a Bell Arrow full face helmet with a smoked colored face shield. OV1 is a 2003 Honda Accord driven by a 51 year old male (5 ft. 10 in. and 208 lbs.). The driver and passengers of OV1 were reportedly wearing the available three-point manual lap and shoulder restraints.

MC1 was traveling northwest at approximately 43 mph in the #2 lane approaching the intersection with a green signal displayed. The rider looked over his shoulder at the motorcycle behind him, when he turned back he saw the signal had phased to red. OV1 was stopped at the westbound limit line waiting to make a left turn. When the signal phased green the driver pulled slowly forward through the gutter-dip where the roads meet into the #2 lane. The rider of MC1 braked, lost control and capsized onto the right side. This caused MC1 to slide approximately 25 ft. on its right side into the left front wheel/bumper of OV1. The rider slid into the left passenger door. MC1?s point of impact (POI) was approximately 12 ft. north of the south curb line of the westbound road and 8 ft. west of the east curb line of the northbound road. The rider impacted the left passenger door approximately 6 ft. 2 in. east of MC1?s POI. The POI locations and final rest positions were the same.","The 23 year-old male rider of MC1 sustained the following injuries as related during the rider interview: minor laceration of the left forearm, left shoulder abrasion and a contusion to the right hip. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 1.",The 51 year-old male driver of OV1 was not injured.,"The 23 year-old male rider of MC1 was operating MC1 without an M1 endorsement or any formal training, failed to perceive the phasing signal due to inattention.",MC1 was modified with 12 in. narrow risers that made it harder to control the movements of MC1.,The eastbound roads negative 12.0% grade combined with the 8.3% crown of the northbound road causes vehicles to transit this dip at extremely low speed.

MC1 had a passenger who fell off before MC1 crashed.,2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 (998cc),,,"This is a single MC losing control while operating with the front tire up in the air (wheelie). MC1 had a passenger. Both the rider and passenger were fully ejected and sustained injures. The crash occurred on a straight roadway that is a non-freeway principal arterial at intersection with another non-freeway principal arterial. The roadway bisects a public beach on the left and wetlands preserve on the right. The roadway has a north/south designation; however, at the crash site, it has a northwest/southeast orientation. MC1 was going northbound. There is no on-street parking on either side of the roadway. Curbs and sidewalks are only present at the intersection area of the roadway. Both sides of the roadway have sandy edges. The roadway has double solid yellow lines as a divider. The crash occurred 33? west of the west curb line of the four-way, non-skewed type intersection that has signal controls. The rider had been stopped for a red light just prior to the crash. Upon receiving the green light, the rider rapidly accelerated, raising the front tire off the ground. The rider rode in this manner until he lost control and crashed just north of the intersection. The roadway has a 0.4% upgrade and a 0.5% crown. The posted speed limit is 50 mph. There were no permanent or temporary visual obstructions that would be contributory to the crash. The roadway is made of an asphalt composition, is worn and polished, but in otherwise good condition. There were no pre or post-impact tire marks. The front tire lost all tire pressure during the crash. MC1 had very low tire pressure (14 psi) in the rear tire the next day when it was inspected which could have been contributory to the crash. The rider has a deformed right arm and hand which is withered and has limited mobility and control which is also contributory. The crash occurred in Southern California in June of 2013 at 1739 hrs. The weather was clear with a temperature of 78 degrees F. There was a moderate wind from the SW. Traffic conditions were moderate.

MC1 was 2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 sport/racing type motorcycle that was being operated by a 47 year old male (6? 00?/170 lbs.) with a 50 year old female (5?05?/170 lbs.) passenger. Neither the rider nor passenger is quoted in the police report. Witnesses told the police that the rider rapidly accelerated when the light phased to green which raised the front tire off the ground, after which, he lost control and crashed. Both the rider and passenger were wearing full- face helmets with integral chin bars and face shields. The rider?s helmet has a FMVSS 218 (US DOT) safety rating and a gray/smoke tinted face shield. It sustained minor abrasions. The passenger?s helmet has both a FMVSS 218 (US DOT) and Snell M2005 safety rating. The face shield was reflective/mirror finish.
 It also sustained minor abrasions.
MC1 was northbound in the #2 (middle) lane stopped for a red light. When the light phased to green, he rapidly accelerated, raising the front tire off the ground and rode in this manner until he lost control and crashed just north of the intersection. The passenger fell off MC1 somewhere in the middle of the intersection. The front tire lost all air pressure. The front rim sustained a large dent/deformation which broke the bead of the tire and allowed the air to escape. The damage to the rim was caused when the front tire landed back onto the roadway surface. Although the tire pressure in the front tire is unknown, it was probably very low. A properly inflated tire would not have allowed the rim to sustain the type of damage that occurred a result of landing from a wheelie. The rear tire had very low pressure which could be contributory to the crash. The rider stated he had checked the tire pressure before riding that day. There were no visible signs of a leak in the rear tire. The rider also stated that there was another vehicle in the lane to his right that was making a lane change into him. The rider said that he was even with the front door of the other vehicle. In reaction to this, the rider stated that he veered to the left and intentionally braked hard and skidded with his rear brake and laid MC1 down on its left side to avoid a collision with that car. The rider said that because of his deformed hand, he never uses the front brake. Neither the police report nor the witness makes mention of another vehicle or skid. The rider stated that his FRP was next to MC1 which is unknown, but was north of the intersection on its left side plane facing in a northerly direction. The passenger said that she fell off MC1 somewhere in the middle if the intersection. Both sustained abrasions to their extremities. Both the rider and passenger were treated at the scene by paramedics and refused to be taken to a hospital. They both went to a walk-in clinic the next day for additional treatment. MC1 was towed.","The 47 year old male operator of MC1 sustained minor injuries consisting of abrasions to his right knee and left calf. The rider has a physical impairment to his right arm and hand. He has limited function to both. This would be contributory to the lack of throttle control. The passenger sustained a fracture of her tail bone, bi-lateral abrasions to her knees, an abrasion to her left elbow, and bi-lateral contusions to her inner thighs. Both were wearing tank tops and shorts. The rider of MC1 showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle. The passenger showed no signs of impairment that would interfere with the rider?s safe operation of MC1.",,The rider of MC1 had a reaction failure in responding to the raise front tire. MC1 was also not properly maintained. ., MC1 sustained moderate damage to the front rim and left side as a result of impacting the roadway and sliding. The low tire pressure could be contributory to the crash. MC1 had evidence of what appeared to be several crashes prior to this crash. There was no reduction in wheelbase.

MC1 had no passenger. ,2005 Suzuki SV 1000 (996cc),2007 Toyota Highlander hybrid,,"This is a crash in which MC1 broadsided OV1 who was making a left turn at an intersection. After the crash, a fuel line leak ignited MC1 and it was completely destroyed by fire. The crash occurred at a four-way, not skewed intersection with signal controls. The roadway is a principal arterial, non-freeway. It has two through lanes in each direction, with dedicated left turn lanes. The roadway also has bike lanes and dedicated right turn lanes. The roadway is straight and level. It has a north/south dedication, but is a northwest/southeast orientation at the crash site. The roadway has curb high center dividers that are landscaped with trees and bushes. The roadway is bordered by concrete curbs. There is a sidewalk on both sides of the roadway; however, the north side sidewalk meanders back and forth away from the roadway and has grass/greenery in between. In the northbound direction, north of the intersection, there is no sidewalk. All sides of the roadway have single family residential homes. No on-street parking is allowed. The roadway is straight and level with a -0.7% downgrade and a 2.0% crown. The posted speed limit is 50 mph. There are no permanent visual obstructions that would be considered contributory to the crash. The roadway is made of an asphalt composition, is worn and polished, but in otherwise good condition. The roadway does have some surface cracking and tar snake repairs in the intersection area of the crash. No pre-impact tire marks were visible from either vehicle. MC1?s FRP was clearly visible due to the burn mark in the roadway. The crash occurred in Southern California in July 2013 at 0858 hrs. The weather was overcast with a temperature of 69 degrees F. The wind was calm. Traffic conditions were light to moderate. The rider was fully ejected and sustained injuries.

MC1 was 2005 Suzuki SV1000 sport/racing type motorcycle that was being operated by a 23 year old male (5? 07?/140 lbs.). The rider said that he was on his to work from home. He was wearing a full face Icon helmet with integral chin bar and a reflective/mirror face shield. The helmet had labeling for FMVSS 218 (DOT) and ECE 22-05 safety ratings. The helmet was retained on the rider?s head to the completion of the crash.
 
The rider of MC1 stated that he was northbound in the # 2 lane at a speed of 50-55 mph. The posted speed limit is 50 mph. He said that he was on his way to work and not in any particular hurry. The 18 year old male (5?11?/150 lbs.) driver of OV1 never responded and was not interviewed. The driver of OV1 told the police that he was making a left turn on a green arrow and that there were no pedestrians. Witnesses stated that there was a pedestrian crossing with the green light/walk signal, which is why OV1 stopped. As MC1 was approaching the intersection, he stated that he saw OV1 in the southbound left turn lane starting to make its left turn. The rider stated that he then changed lanes from the #1 lane to the #2 lane, anticipating that OV1 would stop before he reached the intersection. The rider stated that OV1 continued with the left turn, then stopped in the middle of the intersection, blocking his path. The rider said that when OV1 stopped, he had no time to react at that point. He stated however that he was able to let off the throttle, honk his horn, and swerve to the right. The driver of OV1 and witnesses put MC1 in the #2 lane, never in the #1 lane. MC1 then impacted OV1 on the right front side. The rider was fully ejected, vaulted above ride height and impacted the windshield, then fell to the roadway. The fuel tank was deformed by both the rider and the impact with OV1. It appears that the deformation allowed a gap in the fuel cap filler area. Gasoline then leaked out and ignited, burning MC1 into a mostly melted mass. The right front axle of OV1 was broken. Both vehicles were towed. There were no tire marks from either vehicle. The air pressure in either of MC1?s tires at the time of the crash or after is unknown because they were deflated during the fire. The front tire/rim was separated from MC1. The hub of the front tire was separated from the rest of the rim. What was left of the rear tire that was visible and not charred showed no evidence of braking. The rider was unconscious for an unknown short period of time. He stated that he remembers waking up and seeing MC1 on fire. Witnesses and/or bystanders took photos on their cell phones of the crash scene and forwarded them to the rider, who in turn provided them to the team. The roadway surface has a burn scar where MC1 was. The rider landed in between MC1 and OV1. MC1 appears to have an FRP near the POI. It was on its left side plane and had rotated approximately 90 degrees in a CCW rotation facing in a westerly direction. OV1 rolled forward and came to rest a short distance from the POI and was facing in an easterly direction. The intersection is controlled by overhead electronic multi-phase signals with leading protected only left turns. It was determined by the police that OV1 violated the red arrow signal. The rider of MC1 was taken and admitted to a hospital for 8 days."," The 23 year old male operator of MC1 sustained major injuries consisting of a pelvic ring fracture, pneumothorax, unknown number of rib fractures on the left side, a closed distal radial/ulnar fracture of the right arm, an open comminuted fracture of the radius on the left arm, a laceration and abrasions. The rider was wearing upper protective apparel only and it had no effect on injury prevention. The rider of MC1 showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.",The driver of OV1 was not injured and showed no signs of impairment. ,The driver of OV1 made a decision failure making a left turn against a red arrow. The rider had a reaction failure in not braking and/or swerving and anticipating that the OV would clear the intersection.,"MC1 sustained major damage as a result of impacting OV1 and the ensuing fire that resulted from the crash. There was a maximum reduction in wheelbase that is unknown. The front tire impacted the radiator and exhaust pipes before breaking. The front tire/wheel assembly was broken from the front forks/axle, and the forks were broken. A static measurement of the wheelbase was not possible. The pre-crash condition of MC1 is unknown.

It was daylight, the temperature was between 79 and 82 degrees F. and the winds were S to SSW between 9.2 to 8.1 mph. The asphalt roadway surface was dry, noted to be travel worn and there was heavy congested traffic.

The crash occurred at a 4 way skewed uncontrolled intersection, on a straight north/south road that has a 3.1% positive northbound grade, 8.8% crown and a speed limit of 40 mph. There are two through lanes and one left turn lane in both directions in both directions. The west leg of the intersection is not involved in this crash. The east leg of the intersection is a single 20 ft. lane in each direction with a 3.1% grade and a 3.8% crown.
MC1 is a 2011 Suzuki GSX-R600 (599cc) Sport/race replica motorcycle ridden by a 25 year old male (5 ft. 7 in. and 170 lbs.) the MC1 passenger was a 20 year old female (5 ft. 2 in. and 115 lbs.).

OV1 is a 2012 Ford Fiesta driven by a 25 year old male (6 ft. 1 in. and 175 lbs.). The driver of OV1 was reportedly wearing the available three-point manual lap and shoulder restraints.

MC1 was traveling north at approximately 35 mph in the right hand side of lane #2, passing stopped traffic approaching the uncontrolled intersection. OV1 was southbound stopped in the left turn lane making a left turn onto the east leg of the intersection. Neither the rider nor the driver saw each other. MC1 struck OV1 at a relative heading angle of 95 degrees at the A pillar, as OV1 rolled forward to its final rest position (FRP), MC1 pivoted clockwise, impacting the right side of OV1 and low sided onto its left side.
The rider of MC1 fell within 6 ft. of the point of impact (POI) while the passenger of MC1 was launched above ride height across the hood of OV1 and came to rest 20 ft. 7 in. north of the POI.","The 25 year-old male rider of MC1 sustained the following injuries as related during the rider interview: muscle strains of the right

This is a crash in which MC1 lost control while accelerating too fast over a speed bump in a parking lot thoroughfare to a large retail center. The rider of MC1 slowed for a speed bump and some pedestrians ahead. The pedestrians waved the rider through because they were elderly and walking very slow. The loss of control started when the motorcyclist began to accelerate while going over a speed bump. Per the witness, the front tire immediately came up off the ground and it appeared that the rider had no control. MC1 veered to the right, striking the curb to the planter area with its rear tire. The front tire was still up in the air. The rider was fully ejected and skidded/slid in a southerly direction into the next planter area. After striking the curb with its rear tire and ejecting the rider, MC1 continued in a southwesterly direction in an unknown dynamic, eventually landing on its right side plane and impacting OV1 which was parked and unoccupied. The thoroughfare is 30? wide and divided by a skip-dash single yellow painted line. On either side are curb high oval planters with trees and bushes. The planters are 36? long and run parallel as end caps to the double rows of 17? head to head parking stalls. There is a 23? space between planters.
There were no pre-impact tire marks of any kind from MC1. Gouges start prior to MC1 impacting OV1. MC1 has both front and rear damage. It appears that the front end damage is from impacting OV1. The broken rear rim may have been caused by striking a planter curb. The curbs were examined. All had several tire marks. None of the marks could be positively attributed to this crash. The overall dynamics of MC1 after the first harmful event in this crash are unknown. The parking lot was flat, level, made of an asphalt composition and in good condition. MC was proceeding in a southeasterly direction on the thoroughfare. The main portion of the parking lot would be on the riders? right. The painted parking stalls face each other in a northerly and southerly direction and run westerly through the lot towards the stores. There is no posted speed limit. There are no permanent visual obstructions that would be considered contributory to the crash. The diagram in the accident report shows OV1 parked in stall #2 at its FRP, along with MC1 next to it. When OV1 was inspected, the owner of OV1 said that it was parked in that stall. Scrapes found at the scene that were thought to have been made by MC1 have been dismissed as being involved which eliminates a lot of confusion as to conflicting statements and measurements. Adding to the confusion are measurements taken by the police that indicate the POI between MC1 and OV1 is further north and west from where the FRPs are which do not coincide with other crash dynamics. The crash occurred in Southern California in August of 2013 at 1155 hrs. The weather was cloudy, partly cloudy with a temperature of 74 degrees F. The wind was moderate from the SSW. Traffic conditions were light. It is unknown if the rider was ejected or stayed with MC1 to their FRPs. The rider sustained minor injuries.

MC1 was 2012 Yamaha YZF-R6 sport/racing type motorcycle that was being operated by a 20 year old male (6? 02?/205 lbs.) who did not participate for an interview. The rider said that he was going southbound through the parking lot and when he attempted to ride over the speed bump he gave MC1 too much gas and ?whiskey throttled? (sic) the accelerator and lost control. He was wearing an unknown make full face helmet with integral chin bar and face shield. The helmet has unknown ratings.

MC1 was southbound in the #1 lane at an unknown, but very slow speed to allow two elderly pedestrians to cross ahead of him. MC1 was also approaching a speed bump. When the pedestrians gave up their right of way, MC1 accelerated. It would appear that the rider inadvertently released the clutch completely along with too much throttle, causing MC1 to go into a wheelie. It is unknown what, if any contribution the speed bump had on this crash. MC1 then veered to the right and ran off the roadway into a curb high planter box. This impact fractured the rear rim causing the tire to go flat. The rider was fully ejected at that time and skidded/slid into the next planter area, impacting a tree and then some bushes. MC1 continued in a southwesterly direction. At some point, MC1 was on its right side plane. MC1 then impacted OV1 to the right front side. According to the witness, there was another vehicle parked in the next stall to the right of OV1. Somehow, MC1 made no contact with that other vehicle and ended up on its tires, facing in a northerly direction, leaning against the right side of OV1."," The 20 year old male operator of MC1 sustained minor injuries consisting of a concussion (he called the witness mom) and abrasions to his face, right arm, and both legs. He was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and released. It is unknown what, if any protective apparel the rider was wearing. The rider of MC1 showed no signs of impairment that would otherwise inhibit her ability to operate a motor vehicle.",OV1 was properly and legally parked in a marked stall and was unoccupied at the time of the crash. ,"The rider of MC1 had a reaction error. Based on the rider?s age and year of MC1, lack of experience may also come into play.","MC1 sustained minor damage mostly to the front and right side. MC1 was equipped with what appears to be privately made crash bars covering the engine area. They are somewhat rough in appearance and not painted. There was no reduction in wheelbase. The pre-crash condition would be labeled as very good.

OV1 sustained minor visible damage consisting of dents and scratches to the right front side. The owner said that the frame was bent in the right front area. OV1 had other pre-existing damage to the front center and roof. The pre-crash condition of OV1 would be described as fair.",The speed bump could be considered as a minor contribution to this crash.

MC1 was a 2013 Kawasaki ZX-6R Ninja sport race replica (636cc) replica motorcycle being operated by a 26 year old male rider. The rider was travelling at an unusually high rate of speed northbound on the major arterial street splittingbetween the #3 and #4 traffic lanes while approaching the intersection.
 
OV1 was a 1997 Toyota Avalon 4 door sedan being operated by 35 year old male driver. OV1 was initially stopped for a red light at the intersection occupying the first position of the #2 (outside) south to eastbound left turn lane. The driver of OV1 received a fresh green arrow to proceed into the intersection. The driver of OV1 did not see or have any idea that MC1 was approaching the intersection at a high rate of speed. The driver of OV1 accelerated into the intersection while the northbound lanes of traffic were now stopped for a solid red light. OV1 was travelling at a speed of about 22 mph (32 fps).
The rider of MC1 continued northbound splitting lanes between the stopped traffic in the #3 & #4 lanes and was now at the intersection. The rider continued northbound passing over the marked crosswalk and entering the intersection having failed to notice or stop for the red light. The rider had moved into the plane of the intersection a distance of about 35 feet when OV1 crossed into his path. Witness accounts of MC1?s speed prior to impacting OV1 varied between 50 and 100 mph and there was no indication of the rider attempting to brake or commit to any type of collision maneuver. There was no evidence of skid marks or a lay down scrapes prior to impact.
MC1 struck OV1 at the right front passenger side door just behind the A-pillar causing the passenger door to collapse into the passenger compartment. The motorcycle intruded into the passenger compartment approximately 36 inches and included the rider. The impact stopped all forward motion of OV1 and redirected its movement in a type of northbound arc collapsing the left side tires and right rear tire. OV1 came to rest facing in a southwest direction approximately 29 feet north of its original direction of travel and 12 feet offset to the east.
During this redirection of OV1 both MC1 and the rider had been effectively captured into or about the passenger compartment. As the vehicle swung in its arc both the rider and MC1 fell out onto the roadway surface. The rider was dead at the scene and the driver of OV1 had sustained minor injuries having no recollection of the crash events.","The 26 year old male rider of MC1 sustained fatal injuries as a result of the collision.

The helmet sustained surface abrasion type damage but remained secure on the riders head throughout the crash event.
The rider was travelling westbound in the #1 lane of the multi-lane surface street approaching the signal controlled intersection at a speed of approximately
 
45 mph. The rider noticed the signals for his direction of travel had begun to phase from green to yellow. He increased his speed in order to pass through the intersection before the red phase. As the rider moved through the intersection he attempted to back off on the throttle to decrease his speed. It was during this transition the rider told me the ?fly-by-wire? throttle malfunctioned causing it to ?go wide open?. MC1 rapidly accelerated beyond the rider?s control.
MC1 was equipped with 18 inch high rise style handlebars and the rider lost control of his grip during the rapid acceleration. This caused the rider to shift position from the rider?s seat, to the passenger seat and onto the rear fender. The rider then slid off the fender onto the roadway surface.
MC1 continued westbound another 1,800 feet passing through another signal controlled intersection before drifting towards the center of the roadway riding up onto a raised median striking an overhead concrete street light and surface vegetation.	MC1 finally collapsed onto the left side and slid to a stop adjacent to the north side of the roadway. No other vehicles or pedestrians came in contact with MC1.","The 35 year old male rider sustained minor injuries as a result of falling of his motorcycle. The injuries sustained were a broken right radius bone of the forearm, numerous abrasions to his back and arms, and laceration to the middle finger of the left hand.",,"The rider was found to be properly licensed, insured and there was no evidence of alcohol and/or drug intoxication.","The motorcycle (MC1) sustained major front end and left side damage however, appeared to have been in satisfactory operating condition prior to the crash.",There were no environmental factors that were determined to have contributed to the cause or outcome of this crash event.

The helmet was retained on the rider?s head to the end of the crash event. The helmet sustained only minor freckles on the back side from when the rider laid his head onto the roadway.
The rider stated that he had just left the gym and was on his way home when the crash occurred. He stated that after making a right turn he thought that he had gone out to the #2 lane and was proceeding eastbound. As he approached the intersection, he saw OV1 stopped at the stop sign, when suddenly she pulled out in front of him making a left turn. He remembered braking and locking the rear wheel. He stated that he then impacted the OV and flew across the hood and landed in the street. He then remembered the OV rolling and he was beginning to get trapped under the tires. He was able to crawl away from the tires and the car stopped. The 20 year old female driver (5? 03?/127 lbs.) of OV1 said that she was northbound and was stopped at the stop sign. She stated that she had been at the stop sign for approximately 3 minutes waiting for traffic to clear. When she saw no cars on her side of the road, she pulled out and was impacted by MC1. She stated that she never saw MC1 and that he must have been speeding.	MC1 left approximately 31? of rear tire skid before leaving approximately 12? of front tire skid.

MC1 was a 2006 Kawasaki ZX-6R Ninja sport/racing type motorcycle with some minor modifications including front turn signals, the removal of the passenger foot pegs and rear plastic fender. The rider was a 37 year old male (5? 09?/128 lbs.). He was wearing a full face helmet with a clear face shield. The helmet had no safety rating markings; however, a check on the manufacturer web site indicates that all their helmets are ECE 22-05 rated. The helmet was retained on the rider?s head to the end of the crash event.
 
The rider stated that he was traveling northbound in the #2 lane at approximately 50-55 mph when NC-OV1 made a left turn in front of him. There were two independent witnesses who stated the same story. The driver of NC-OV1 never stopped prior to turning. The driver did stop blocking the #1 lane. The rider stated he braked and started to skid, then swerved to the right in an attempt to avoid NC-OV1. He lost control and went down, sliding across the intersection and into the curb. No pre-impact tire friction marks were visible when the scene was inspected. None were noted in the police accident report. The police accident report only documented the impact of MC1 into the curb as a POI. There is a slight crest in the roadway; however it would not be considered a contributory factor as a permanent view obstruction. Visibility is over 300?. At 50 mph (rider?s statement), over 4 seconds would lapse prior to any impact allowing either party to react normally to prevent a crash. The rider said that he was fully ejected.

When MC1 was inspected the morning after the crash, both tires were found to have extremely low (below 40% recommended) air pressure. This could be a contributing factor to the crash when combined with the speed, turning, and heavy braking. MC1 sustained major damage from impacting the curb. This impact fractured the engine case on the right side and caused the fairing to fragment off MC1. It appears that MC1 went down first on its left side and then flipped after impacting the curb. Both sides had significant damage. It appears that MC1 slid on one side first, then flipped after impacting the curb.	The damage from sliding on its left side was mostly cosmetic, consisting of scratches to the side covers, clutch lever, and handlebar. The frame had one small dent where the left side handle bar impacted it just below the gas tank. There appeared to be some minor pre-existing damage on MC1. According to the rider, MC1 had been re-painted and the only visible pre-existing damage was to the right handlebar.","The 37 year old male operator of MC1 sustained minor injuries consisting of abrasions and contusions to his knees, hip, buttocks, arms, and hands. He was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and released. The rider of MC1 showed signs of impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.",The driver of NC-OV1 fled the scene. Any impairment is unknown. ,The driver of NC-OV1 had either a perception or decision failure. The rider had a reaction failure in over-braking which caused him to go down.,MC1 had very low tire pressure (below 40% recommended) in both tires which would contribute to poor handling and probably contributed to the crash. There was no reduction in wheelbase. The pre-crash condition would be labeled as fair.,There were no environmental conditions that would be considered contributory to this crash.

The rider stated that he saw the OV exiting the east side driveway and crossing the lanes of traffic. The rider stated that once entering the roadway, the OV never stopped. The OV completed its left turn and was slowly proceeding southbound in the #1 lane. The rider saw the brake lights come on and the OV began changing lanes to
 
the right. The rider backed off on the throttle and changed lanes to the right. The OV then continued changing lanes to the right and was nearly perpendicular to the roadway and trying to enter another driveway on the west side of the roadway. The rider stated that he over-braked and lost control when the OV blocked his lane. The rider stated that he knew he locked the front brake and should have released it and re-applied it, but didn?t. He said that MC1 high sided and went down on its left side plane, then skidded/slid into OV1. The rider stated that he skidded across the roadway to about the middle of the driveway that the OV drove into and was near the lane line for the #3 and #2 lanes. The 19 year old male driver (5?08?/150 lbs.) of OV1 stated in the police accident report that he didn?t see MC1 because of the trees and bushes in the center divider. Visibility from the driveway that OV1 exited is partially obscured by the trees and bushes (photo 0352CS10); however, from the middle of the roadway and into the southbound lanes, they are not a factor.

The rider had been stopped at a red light a block away. When the light phased to green, he accelerated to a stated 40-45 mph. The rider was in the #2 lane ahead of all other traffic. The rider stated that the rear end began to ?feel funny, unstable? and he felt as if he was starting to go into a high speed wobble. He stated that the unstable condition then progressively got worse and also affected the front end of MC1. He stated that the handlebars were violently turning from side to side, commonly referred to as a ?tank slapper.? The rider
 
stated that he had experienced a high speed wobble in the past on the same motorcycle and was able to remedy the situation by applying his brakes. He stated that he did apply both front and rear brakes, at which time he lost control and crashed. There were no pre-crash skid marks from MC1. When the crash scene was inspected, a gouge was located just prior to the out of control front tire marks in the roadway. After MC1 went down on its left side plane, it impacted the curb slid for approximately 431? to its FRP. Using a coefficient of friction of 0.5, this slide alone puts MC1?s speed at approximately 82 mph. This calculation does not take into account the bleeding off of speed caused by 3 gouges; the impact with the curb; the tire friction marks from the wobble; or any braking that the rider may have done. It appears that MC1 was taking the curve at a high speed and was into a low lean angle which caused the left side
footboard and mounting bracket to make a hard contact with the roadway surface and dig into the roadway. This is the First Harmful Event. This caused MC1 to start to go out of control.

MC1 was a 2011 Suzuki DRZ 400S (398cc) dual sport type motorcycle. The 19 year old male (5?03?/145 lbs.) rider stated that he was wearing a Fly full face helmet with no face shield. He had non-prescription goggles with clear lenses. The helmet?s safety ratings and any damage is unknown. The rider stated that he was wearing an armored jacket, jeans, military style boots, and armored leather gloves. The helmet remained in place to the completion of the crash
 
events.	MC1 was northbound from a signal that had just phased to green. He was in the #1 (left) lane and had just passed on the left the lead vehicle ahead of him by going into the two-way left turn lane. There was another vehicle that had just exited the south driveway of a parking lot, north of the intersection that was making a left turn. There are discrepancies in the police report as to whether MC1 went behind or in front of this vehicle. According to the driver of OV1, MC1 went to the rear of that vehicle. In doing this, MC1 wound up in the northbound #2 (right) lane. It was when MC1 was passing the vehicle making the left turn out of the driveway that the driver of OV1 first saw MC1. The driver of OV1 said that MC1 was going so fast he didn?t know what to do. He stopped, blocking both northbound lanes. The driver of OV1 stated that he knew MC1 was going to crash into him, so he turned his head away from the windows. He then felt and heard MC1 impact his vehicle. The driver of OV1 stated that he thought that MC1 might have tried to make a right turn into the same driveway that he had just exited in an attempt to avoid the crash. The driver of OV1 stated that he had open road ahead that would have made it possible to complete his left turn and
not block the roadway. The rider of MC1 stated that he remembered that OV1 pulled out in front of him and that he braked hard to avoid crashing. He stated that he locked up his brake and released it, then re-applied it. He stated that he thought he might have tried to turn into the driveway that the OV came out of because braking wasn?t slowing him down enough, but wasn?t sure. MC1 sustained no reduction in wheelbase. The roadway south of the signal that MC1 had been stopped at has a right curve that ends at the signal. There were no visible tire marks from either vehicle at the crash scene. Only a few minor scrapes on the roadway surface were located at MC1?s FRP. MC1?s FRP was in the northbound #2 lane, approximately at the mid-point of the driveway. Based on the damage to OV1, it does appear that MC1 was attempting a right turn and that the impact angle was less than 90 degrees. The front tire of MC1 was found flat. There were no obvious causes found as to why there was no air pressure. The rear tire air pressure was between 16% and 39% below recommended levels.
The rear tire mark from MC1 was not visible at the time the scene was inspected. Based on the police report measurements for the fluid spill, it appears that MC1 fell over onto its right side plane after impact. MC1 was moved prior to the arrival of the police, so its orientation at its FRP is not known.","The 19 year old male operator of MC1 sustained minor injuries consisting of a minor laceration to his right knee, an abrasion to his right elbow, and a decreased level of consciousness. When the rider was interviewed, he stated he had very limited memory of the crash and was suffering from short term memory loss. He was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and released. He displayed no signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.", The 83 year old male operator of OV1 was not injured and did not display any signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.,The rider of MC1 had a decision failure in weaving through traffic and passing other vehicles at a high rate of speed as compared to the rest of the traffic.,"MC1 sustained moderate damage to the left side from impacting OV1 then the roadway surface. The left side of the handlebar was broken off. The transmission case had a hole punched into it from the shifter. The pre-crash condition would be labeled as good.

OV1 sustained moderate damage to the left side, mostly in the area of left rear door, but extends from the left front door rearward to the left rear wheel.
 
Damage was also located below the body on the frame.",There were no environmental factors that would be considered contributory to this crash.

The roadway surface was level, of an asphalt composition which appeared to be dry, worn and polished otherwise in satisfactory condition.
The collision occurred west of a four way multi-phase signal controlled intersection on a straight, multiple lane major arterial. The street has an overall travel-way width of 95 feet. There are a total of six lanes dedicated for vehicular traffic; three for eastbound and three for westbound traffic. The east and westbound lanes of traffic are separated by a raised concrete median that is approximately 4 feet in width from the intersection and extends for 175 until it
expands to 14 feet in width over an additional distance of 165 feet. The remainder of the street is separated by a 14 foot wide two-way left turn lane.	There are two designated left turn lanes for east to northbound traffic.

Environmental and Crash Specifics (continued):
The north side of the street and east side of the signal controlled intersection are uninvolved with this crash event. There are also no designated ?Bike Lanes? on the north and south side of the roadway.

The roadway in the area of the crash site is straight with a slight uphill grade of 1.1%. The crown affecting the eastbound lanes of traffic is 2.0%. There is a posted speed limit of 45 mph for both directions of travel. There were no super-elevation issues with this roadway. There were no significant roadway grade or, crown issues with the roadway surface, in the area preceding, at or, beyond the crash site.
The case vehicle (MC1) was a 2013 Yamaha YZF R1 (sport race replica) style motorcycle (silver) being operated by a 25 year old male. The rider was wearing a DOT approved Shoei RF1100 full face motorcycle helmet. Prior to the interview the rider claimed he had since disposed of the helmet soon after the crash.
 
OV1 was a 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche (sport activity vehicle) being operated by a 28 year old female with no passengers on board. OVD was returning home travelling eastbound in the #1 lane approaching the intersection intending to enter the #2 left turn lane to proceed northbound on the cross street. Her speed on approach was about 30mph.
MCR was also traveling eastbound in the designated #1 lane of the multi-lane surface street approaching the intersection. The rider had been traveling at an approximate speed of 45 mph and was closing on OV1.
The driver of OV1 started to move her vehicle from the #1 eastbound lane into the	#2 left turn lane. Her speed was still 30 mph however she began to reduce her speed because the signal light ahead at the intersection was in the red phase.
The MCR at first intended to pass OV1 by entering the 14 foot wide two-way left turn lane. He felt that his approach speed to OV1 was too fast (45mph vs 30mph). MCR suddenly realized that the two-way left turn lane terminate at the raised concrete median so he swerved back into the #1 eastbound lane. It had been his intention to also enter the left turn lane however, once he positioned himself back into the #1 lane he was once again closing on OV1 at a higher rate of speed and, OV1 was beginning to slow down.
MCR attempted to avoid colliding with OV1 by briefly applying his brakes and swerving to the left. The riders closing speed was too fast and the right front portion of his motorcycle impacted with the left rear corner of OV1.
The resulting impact caused MC1 to collapse left side down on to the roadway surface and ejected the rider. MC1 slid about 70 feet until coming to rest against the raised center median, facing north. The rider (MCR) rolled and/or tumbled for a distance of about 55 feet from the initial area of impact.
MC1 sustained moderate right front and left side damage to the bumper and fairing as well as scraping along the left side from striking the roadway surface. OV1 sustained minor damage to the rear bumper and left rear quarter panel.
While inspecting the crash scene I located what appeared to be a rear tire scuff about 6 feet in length running parallel to the lanes of travel and lined up just inside the left turn lane area. I also located two scuff marks that appeared to be from the riders clothing. These scuff marks also ran parallel to the lanes of travel and were inside the left turn lane area. At the time of the collision there were no other vehicles, pedestrians, animals or, environmental conditions that caused or contributed to the crash event.",The 25 year old rider of MC1 sustained non-life threatening injuries as a result of the collision.

The rider stated that she was riding in the rear position of a staggered formation with her
 
boyfriend cruising at about 35 mph. The crash occurred about two miles from the rider?s home. She stated that suddenly the accelerator started to rev up and she began to gain speed. She pulled in the clutch and applied the brakes. The motorcycle then began to wobble and she lost control. She intentionally laid MC1 down on its left side plane in an effort to avoid crashing into the curb. She stated that she held onto MC1 for a short distance until she realized that MC1 was headed for the curb. She did not want to hit the curb, so she let go. She then skidded/slid to her FRP. MC1 continued sliding away from her, impacted the curb and came to rest further down the road. MC1 was ridden to the rider?s home by one of the firefighters. The investigating officer stated in the accident report that when he checked the throttle it stuck one time. He determined that it was the throttle lock control (cruise control) that was possibly adjusted a little too tight. When MC1 was inspected 17 days after the crash, the throttle worked fine. The air pressure in both tires was below 50% the recommended pressure. This may have been contributory to the crash as the rider was negotiating a left curve and inadvertently accelerating and then braking, which could have caused some unstable conditions. The rider?s inexperience in how to respond to the mechanical failure was also contributory. MC1 skidded/slid on its side for a distance of approximately 109? which calculated to a speed of approximately 40 mph. Damage to MC1 was minimal and consisted of mostly minor scrapes. The rider was treated at the scene and then taken to a local hospital where she was treated and released.", The 50 year old female operator of MC1 sustained minor injuries consisting mostly abrasions and one minor laceration. She displayed no signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit her ability to operate a motor vehicle.,, The rider of MC1 had a reaction failure of improperly responding to the conditions presented to her which were a combination of mechanical issues combined with speed and over-braking.,MC1 had very low air pressure in both tires which would be considered contributory to the unstable nature of MC1 while negotiating the curve and over-braking. The probable cause of the undesired increase in speed could be attributed to the throttle lock that the new rider was not familiar with. The pre-crash condition of MC1 would be considered new.,There were no permanent or temporary environmental factors that are considered contributory to this crash.

The rider was proceeding westbound and his speed was about 30mph/44fps. The surrounding westbound traffic was at a distance of about 45-60 feet in front of his position. As the rider continued westbound he noticed that the traffic ahead of him was rapidly slowing down. The rider reacted to this sudden slowdown by applying the brakes hard. The result of this application of the brakes caused the scooter to lose control on the wet roadway surface and collapse left side down. When the scooter collapsed, the rider initially stayed with the vehicle however was ejected onto the roadway surface sustaining a puncture style injury to his left leg possibly from the brake lever. The scooter slid for a distance of about 45 feet before coming to rest between the #1 and #2 westbound lanes. The rider rolled or slid a distance of about 25 feet from the initial area of impact, and came to rest inside the #1 westbound lane.

MC1 was a 2009 Kawasaki Ninja 250R (249cc) sport race replica motorcycle being operated by an 18 year old male rider. The rider was wearing a DOT/Snell M2010 approved full face motorcycle helmet. The rider was operating his bike outside of his license classification which prohibited the operation of a motorcycle after the hours of darkness. The rider had accelerated to an estimated speed of approximately 40-45 mph, southbound in the designated #2 lane of the minor arterial street approaching the T-intersection and OV1.
 
OV1 was a 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES (automobile) being operated by a 56 year old female driver. The OVD was initially approaching the intersection in the northbound #1 lane however, changed into the two way left turn lane intending to turn left into the pool supply store. OVD had been moving at approximately 5-10 mph and had continued at this speed throughout the intended left turn movement into the driveway. Once the OVD believed the southbound lanes to be clear of traffic she made her left turn movement. OV1 crossed the southbound #1 lane and began to cross the #2 lane when MC1 impacted it along the right side of the vehicle at the B-Pillar. The OVD was not injured by the crash and completed her left turn driving into the parking lot of the store.
The rider had been southbound in the #2 lane accelerating to a speed of about 40-45mph. The rider saw OV1 in the two-way left turn lane however did not anticipate the left turn movement of the vehicle. When OV1 turned the rider attempted to slow down or stop by using his front brake as this was evident by the discovery of approximately 13 feet of pre-impact locked skid marks. The rider told me he had no other option due to the fact that there vehicles occupying the #1 and #3 lanes on either side of him. MC1 struck the right side of OV1in an upright position at the right side B-Pillar.
The resulting impact vaulted the rider off the motorcycle causing his face & helmet to impact the roof line and pivot over the top of OV1. The rider fell to his feet adjacent to the driver side of OV1. MC1 collapsed left side down onto the roadway surface at the area of impact.

The rider was fully ejected and sustained fatal injuries. MC1 had no passenger. MC1 was towed from the scene.

MC1 was a 2003 Yamaha YZF-R6 (599cc) sport/racing street type motorcycle with modifications. The known modifications include the exhaust system, turn signal lights, brake/clutch levers, and a stand on wheelie bar attached to the rear frame that extends beyond the rear tire. The 30 year old male (5?07?/150 lbs.) rider was wearing a Shoei X-Eleven full face motorcycle helmet. The face shield came off during the crash. It was gray/smoke tint. The helmet had labeling showing that it met FVMSS 218 (US DOT) and Snell M2005 safety ratings. The helmet remained in place to the end of the crash sequence and was removed by paramedics. The rider was not wearing any other type of eye protection. The rider was wearing a T shirt, denim jean type pants, and below the ankle athletic shoes.
The area of the crash is a residential zone that has streets designated as either north/south or east/west. They are in a grid type pattern. Stop signs are used for traffic control at every other intersection for the east/west street. There are posted stop signs at the intersection where the crash occurred for east/west traffic. The north/south street does not have a stop sign at the intersections where the east/west street does. The east/west streets have dips and gutter ways on both sides of the intersections that run north and south. It appears that MC1 was westbound at a very high speed. When going through the intersection that is east of the crash site, MC1 became airborne after going through the gutter ways. Upon landing west of the intersection, MC1 lost control.
The front forks began to violently rotate back and forth in what is commonly referred to as a ?tank slapper.? There were	tire marks from the front tire of MC1 that showed MC1 made very rapid, out of control turns before going down on its right side plane. There were also tire marks from the rear tire, some of which were over-lapping with the front tire marks. During this process, MC1 crossed over into the opposing lane of travel. As MC1 continued out of control in a westerly direction, it nearly impacted a parked full size pick-up that was parked on the south side of the street in the eastbound lane of travel. After passing the truck, MC1 went through another gutter way on the east side of the intersection which is when it went down. MC1 high-sided and was on its right side plane and rotated in an unknown direction, but ultimately was sliding backwards. The rider was fully ejected and sliding ahead of MC1. MC1 caught up to the rider and pushed him into and under a parked vehicle, causing fatal injuries. The rider was found in a prone position with his head under the parked vehicle and his legs extending out from the vehicle. The rider was pronounced deceased at the scene. In the on-scene photos, MC1 and the parked vehicle are at their FRPs. The impact of MC1 into the parked vehicle had enough force to move the parked vehicle backwards approximately 2? and push the right front tire up and over the curb. The helmet had been removed from the rider by paramedics and placed near MC1. When inspected, the chin strap was still intact and looped through the double D rings. The reporting officer stated that no one had touched the strap and that the paramedics removed the helmet in the condition that it was inspected. A witness who is a friend of the rider stated that the rider of MC1 was showing his riding abilities to him. The witness stated that the rider rode eastbound first for about a block, then turned around and came westbound. The witness stated that the rider was going fast and went airborne approximately 60 cm (23.6?) after going through a dip in the roadway. He said that the rear tire landed onto the roadway first followed by the front tire, at which time the rider appeared to lose control as indicated by the handlebars rapidly going back and forth. Another witness stated that she saw the rider leaning to the right and MC1 leaning to the left. Witnesses estimated the speed of MC1 to be around 50 mph. Skid/slide formulas and collinear momentum put the speed of MC1 at approximately 87 mph. The front tire air pressure was low at 29 psi, but within 15% of recommended inflation. The rear tire lost all air pressure as a result of the crash. The rider did not have driver?s license. He had been issued an index number for tracking purposes by the DMV. His status to get a license was listed as ?suspended? because of a prior DUI arrest and citation for no license.","The 31 year old male operator of MC1 sustained fatal injuries consisting of: a transection of the brain stem, lacerations to the brain stem; subdural and subarachnoid brain hemorrhages; a thoracic aortic laceration; bi-lateral flail rib fractures; several internal organ lacerations including the liver and spleen; numerous bone fractures including the pelvis, left femur, left tibia and fibula; and numerous lacerations and abrasions. The toxicology results showed that the rider had a BAC of 0.16%. This level is twice the legal limit and most likely impaired his ability to operate a motor vehicle in a safe manner.",,The operator of MC1 had a decision failure in going too fast and riding while legally intoxicated. The rider lives in the neighborhood and should have had known about the dips in the roadway.,MC1 sustained major damage to the right side and rear end. The rear axle arm supports were broken. The rear tire was flat and the rim was fractured. The rear sprocket was bent and the chain dislodged. The modified frame extension which is believed to be used as a wheelie stand for the rider was bent and misshaped. Both the engine case and transmission case were damaged and fluids leaked out. The pre-crash condition of MC1 would be listed as good., There are permanent dips in the roadway for drainage which are contributory to this crash only because of the excessive speed that MC1 was going.

This crash occurred at a four way, non-skewed type intersection that had stop signs posted in all directions. The crash took place during hours of darkness. The area was illuminated by overhead spot illumination. On the rider?s right there are single family residential homes; on the left is an urban park. The approach
to the intersection is an up-hill right curve. In the rider?s direction, the intersection and the two stop signs are visible at a distance greater than 300?. The posted speed limit is 40 mph. The roadway that MC1 was traveling on is a non-freeway minor arterial that has one lane in each direction, bike lanes, and a painted center divider. Parking is allowed during daylight hours. At the intersection, the roadway includes a left turn lane. Both sides of the roadway have concrete sidewalks. Beyond the sidewalk on the right is a landscaped up-slope. On the left is a landscaped down-slope to the park. The intersection was measured to have a crown of 3.5% and a downgrade of -2.0%. The roadway is made of asphalt composition, is worn and polished, but in otherwise good repair. The roadway has a north/south designation but is in a slight northwest/southeast orientation at the crash site. MC1 was southbound at approximately 190 degrees. The weather was clear with a light wind from the SSE. The temperature was +68 degrees F. The crash took place in Southern California in March of 2015 at 2101 hrs. Traffic conditions were light.

MC1 was a 2003 Suzuki SV650 (645cc) cruiser type motorcycle with minor modifications. The known modifications include the exhaust system and rear turn signals. The 32 year old male (5?10?/195 lbs.) rider was wearing an unknown style of helmet and unknown type clothing/protective apparel. The rider of MC1
 
stated that there was a problem with the brakes that unexpectedly locked up on him and caused the crash. He stated that it happened earlier on the freeway. hen MC1 was inspected, there were no obvious signs of any brake problems.

MC1 was riding in the #1 (only) lane which is 18? wide. There is an 8? bike lane to the right near the intersection. On the approach, the configuration changes to an 8? parking lane with a 5? bike lane adjacent to the travel lane. It appears that the rider may have over-braked and lost control after recognizing that he failed to stop for the stop sign. MC1 went down and the left side of the front tire/rim dug into the roadway causing asphalt to pile up into the tire bead area of the rim. The front tire was measured to have only 19 psi. The rear tire was measured to have 25 psi. Both tires were underinflated and may have contributed to the crash by causing instability while braking and turning. MC1 skidded/slid a distance of approximately 118?. Using a coefficient of friction of 0.40 (nylon sliders and downgrade), MC1 was calculated to be going approximately 38 mph. at the time of the crash, which is below the posted speed limit of 40 mph. In using maximum effective braking calculations, MC1 would only need approximately 59? to safely stop. There were no pre-impact tire marks that would indicate heavy braking/skidding. The POI is in the middle of the intersection, indicating that MC1 never stopped for the posted stop sign. It is unknown if MC1 was traveling much faster than the speed limit and attempted to stop before the stop sign. MC1 was riding to the right side of its lane prior to losing control.
After crashing, MC1 slid at a slight angle across the travel lane. This was most likely due to the curve in the roadway prior to the intersection where it appears that the rider was riding to the inside of the curve. The length of curve was measured at 702?. A 100? chord was used to measure the radius. The mid-ordinate was measured to be 9? (0.75?) which calculates to a radius of 1667?. Based on the direction of travel and location of the crash, it appears that the rider may have been on his way home. The rider stated that he was coming from a bar and that he had consumed two 8 ounce beers. During the crash investigation, officers could smell the odor of alcoholic beverages on the rider. After conducting a DUI investigation, the rider was arrested. He was given a breath test which produced results of 0.15% BAC."," The 32 year old male operator of MC1 sustained moderate injuries consisting of an open fracture to the left lower leg, a laceration to his left foot, and abrasions to both arms and back. He was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital. It is unknown if he was admitted. He displayed signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle and was arrested.",,"The operator of MC1was under the influence of alcohol which caused a perception error of him not recognizing the stop sign at the intersection, combined with a reaction error which caused MC1 to go down. There may have been some type of mechanical problem with the brakes per the rider, but that is doubtful based on the inspection. The rider?s BAC level was measured to be 0.15% on a breath test that was taken 1 hour and 15 minutes after the crash."," MC1 sustained minor damage to the left side plane.

MC1 had no passenger.,2014 Kawasaki Ninja EX300B (296cc) ,,,"This crash occurred as the southbound rider was proceeding straight at a constant speed approaching a four-way, skewed, signal controlled intersection. The roadway where the crash occurred is a non-freeway minor arterial that has two through lanes in each direction and dedicated left turn lanes. In the rider?s direction there is also a dedicated right turn lane and an island. Prior to and after the intersection, there is a 14? wide painted divider. In the area of the crash, the divider narrows down to a pair of solid yellow lines in both directions making room for dedicated left turn lanes. The crash occurred during hours of daylight. The surrounding area is comprised commercial/industrial on the right and single family residential homes on the left. The roadway has 8? concrete sidewalk on both sides. The roadway is made of asphalt composition, worn and polished, but in otherwise good condition. The roadway has a north/south designation.

The helmet remained in place to the end of the crash sequence.	It is unknown what safety gear if any the rider was wearing.
 
The rider stated that he was southbound in the #1 lane at an unknown speed approaching the intersection when he hit a ?bump? and lost control. He said that he tried to counter steer to regain control but it didn?t work.	There was no obvious ?bump? in the roadway	when the scene was inspected. Officers noted in the police report that the only ?bump? they could find was a pair of metal triangular water line access lids. These were inspected and no significant ?bump? could be detected. Tire striation marks were located in the southbound #2 lane, south of the intersection. The tire marks were right, left, and right in rapid succession indicating the front forks were out of control. This is commonly referred to as a ?tank slapper?. Immediately following the tire marks, scrapes and minor gouges in the roadway were visible. MC1 slid on its left side plane across the roadway into the northbound #1 lane for a total distance of 201?.
Calculations put MC1?s speed at approximately 50 mph at the time of impact. It is unknown how much faster the rider may have been going on his approach, or whether or not he had both wheels on the ground prior to losing control. The rider stated that after hitting the bump in the roadway, he attempted to counter steer. It is unknown which direction he tried to turn to first and whether or not it may have made a difference in preventing the crash. Approximately 5? of tire marks were located prior to the POI spanning a distance of a little over 23?. They appear to be made from the front tire rapidly rotating left and right out of control, commonly referred to as a tank slapper. After going down on its left side plane, MC1 slid approximately 201? to its FRP in the northbound lanes of the roadway. It is unknown where the rider?s FRP is. MC1 was inspected a few hours after the crash. The rear tire had very low air pressure that was measured to be 20 psi. This could be considered a contributing factor in why MC1 went out of control. The bump in the roadway that the rider mentioned and was inspected is not significant enough to have caused this crash by itself. In the police accident report, the rider stated that he was in the #1 lane. The tire marks and POI do not support the rider?s statement. The transition from the #1 lane to the #2 lane (headed right) where the crash sequence begins would be too sharp of an angle for MC1 to re-direct (headed left) and proceed in the direction it did without other external forces being applied. The rider contributed to this crash with a combination of errors which include high speed, poor maintenance, poor or incorrect reaction, and possibly a lack of experience.",The 20 year old male operator of MC1 sustained minor injuries consisting of abrasions to his extremities. The rider was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and released. The rider displayed no signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.,,The operator of MC1 had a decision failure in riding at an excessive speed and possibly choosing the wrong reaction for his situation.,"MC1 sustained minor damage to the left side as a result of sliding on the roadway surface. The over-sized ?sliders? prevented much more damage from occurring. The left mirror was broken off and there were some minor scrapes to the lower left side cover. The shifter, side stand, and left rear axle nut also sustained some minor scratches. When inspected, the rear tire had a low air pressure reading of 20 psi which could have been contributory for MC1 losing control while negotiating a curve. The pre-crash condition of MC1 would be listed as like new.",The bump in the roadway is only considered a minimal contributing factor due to the excessive speed of MC1.

He stated that he did not see or hear MC1 until the impact. He also said that he did not see the posted no U-Turn sign. The roadway has one lane in each direction and has no painted markings. In the direction of travel for both vehicles, it is a fairly steep up-hill with a left curve. The radius of the curve was calculated to be 1251?. The length of curve was measured at 1154?. The overall length and radius of the curve, combined with the trees in the center divider create a permanent view obstruction as a contributing factor to this crash, especially when excessive speed is added in. By MC1 rider?s own statement, he was going 10-15 mph faster that the posted limit, which is unsafe. The part of OV1 making an illegal U-Turn is also contributory to this crash, but is not as significant a contributing factor as is the speed of MC1. After impact, OV1 continued to move forward a short distance before coming to a stop. Following the initial impact, MC1 side-slapped OV1, causing damage from the driver?s
door reward to the left rear quarter panel. MC1 then went down on its left side plane and was under OV1. Some of the post-crash scrape marks were from MC1 being dragged across the roadway surface onto the tow truck. The rider appears to have been vaulted above ride height and flew over the engine hood. This was determined by a clothing scuff mark on the top of the left fender area and the riders FRP as indicated in the police accident report. The impact activated numerous air bags inside OV1.

The rider stated that he was westbound in the #1 (left) lane going approximately 40 mph and was to the left side of the lane. He said that the OV was next to him in the #2 (right) lane. The rider said that he was near the rear quarter panel of OV1 when the driver ?suddenly? put on his left turn signal, then immediately turned left. The rider thought that the OV might be trying to make a U-turn. He said that he had no time to react and impacted OV1 on the left front side. He was ejected from MC1 and flew across the hood of the car. He stated that he ?went right? and that OV1 went to the left and somehow ran him over. The driver of OV1 stated that he had just exited a driveway from a fast food location after looking and saw that the roadway was ?clear.? He then heard a loud ?boom? and saw MC1 ?flying.? Witnesses saw the crash but were not sure where OV1 came from. After impacting OV1, MC1 went down on its right side plane and skidded/slid for approximately 114? diagonally across the roadway and intersection coming to rest at the south side curb line. MC1 was still at its FRP when the police arrived. OV1 had been moved. There was a post impact tire mark made by MC1 prior to the scrapes and gouges.

He displayed no signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit the safe operation of a motor vehicle.,"The operator of OV1 had a perception failure in not seeing MC1 ahead of other traffic approaching when he entered the roadway. Had the driver of OV1 stayed in the right lane as the law requires when entering the roadway, there would not have been a crash. The operator of MC1 could possibly have done a better job of anticipating the actions of OV1 and taken some pre-crash precautions which may not have prevented the crash, but could have lessened the impact and injuries","MC1 sustained moderate damage to the entire right side from impacting OV1 and sliding on the roadway. The front suspension, fairing, gas tank, right side crash bar, foot board, brake pedal, saddle bag, and exhaust all sustained damage. The seat was broken off as a result of the crash. There was no reduction in wheelbase. The pre-crash condition of MC1 would be listed as very good.

OV1 sustained moderate damage starting at the leading edge of the driver?s door and proceeding forward, ultimately pulling off the front bumper.

The rider stated that he had just left his mother?s residence and was headed to the store. He stated that traffic was very heavy due to the construction up ahead. He said that he was eastbound in the #2 (curb) lane at 30-35 mph. He said that the #1 (left) lane was stopped. In the police accident report, the rider stated that he came upon stopped cars and passed them on the right, between the cars in the #2 lane and the curb. He said that as he approached the area of the driveway, he saw OV1 making its left turn in front of him. He stated that he applied the rear brake and tried to swerve right. The skid mark from the rear tire shows a straight line skid that is angled to the right. The tire mark starts approximately 5? north of the SCL and terminates near the POI at approximately 3? north of the SCL. Based on the tire mark, it would appear that the rider was able to make a slight swerve to the right before applying and locking up the rear
brake. The rider could not remember if he applied any front brake or not. The rider remembered impacting the right front of OV1 and then flying over the hood and landing on the sidewalk. The driver of OV1 stated that he was attempting to make a left turn into the driveway and traffic was very heavy and backed up. He stated that the cars in both eastbound lanes stopped and left a gap for him to make his turn. He said that as he slowly made his way across the eastbound lanes, MC1 appeared traveling eastbound along the curb and impacted the right front of his car. The driver stated that he never saw MC1 prior to the crash.
After the crash, MC1 landed on its right side plane facing northeast. The front tire was in the roadway and the rear tire was on the apron of the driveway. OV1 was pushed slightly east with its front tires ending up just south of the SCL. The front tire of MC1 was forced rearward and impacted the frame/radiator."," The 60 year old male operator of MC1 sustained minor injuries consisting of an abrasion to his right bicep and bi-lateral abrasions to his hands. The rider was taken to a local hospital where he was treated and then released.

MC1 was a stolen 2013 Triumph Thruxton conventional style motorcycle being operated by a 30 year old unlicensed male rider.	The rider was traveling at a speed of about 30-35 mph northbound on the local street while approaching the intersection.	The rider was wearing a HJC model CS-R2 FMVSS 218 DOT approved (black) full face motorcycle helmet with a clear colored visor. The status of MC1 at the time of this crash event was it had been reported stolen from
 
a neighboring city.
OV1 was a 2004 Ford Ranger XLT pick-up truck being operated by a licenced 30 year old male driver. OV1 was traveling southbound on the local street and was in the process of making a U-turn type movement at the intersection in order to continue northbound through the neighborhood.	There was no other traffic in proximity of the intersection and there were no special conditions such as roadwork or obstructions on the roadway or at the intersection.
As the rider was traveling at an approximate speed of 30-35 mph as he approached the intersection. At the same time the driver of OV1 was approaching the intersection and starting his U-turn. As the rider approached OV1 he initiated a collision avoidance maneuver in an attempt to avoid hitting the vehicle. The rider first applied and locked up his rear brake. This was evident by the 33? 9? long skid mark left on the roadway. The rider also applied and locked up his front brake. This was also evident by a 26? 8? mark left on the roadway. The termination of the rear brake and start of the locked front brake over lapped each other by about 5 feet. By the appearance of the relatively straight skid marks it does not appear as though the rider attempted to steer away from the impending collision.
At or near the termination of the front brake skid, the rider lost control of MC1 and it collapsed right side down on to the roadway sliding about 11 feet just prior to impacting near the right side of OV1. As MC1 collapsed onto the roadway, the rider was ejected and either slid or tumbled into right front quarter panel of OV1.
Both MC1 and the rider came to rest just inside the intersection at or near the area of impact between the two-vehicles.

degrees F. There was a light wind from the SSW. The crash took place in August 2015 in Southern California at 1449 hrs. There was no construction in the area of the crash. Traffic conditions were moderate. Both vehicles were towed.

MC1 was a 2000 Yamaha YZFR6 (599cc) sport/racing type motorcycle with minor modifications which included lighting, exhaust, sliders, seat, and slightly oversized tires. None of the modifications had any contribution to the crash. The 25 year old male (5? 06?/180 lbs.) rider was wearing a thin cotton short sleeved shirt, thin cotton shorts, low cut athletic shoes and no gloves. The rider was wearing an ICON Airmada full face helmet with integral chin bar and a smoke colored face shield.

There was no evidence of a helmet strap failure. When inspected, the helmet straps were in good condition and undone. There were no excessive wear marks or burn/stretch markings. Inside the helmet cracks and denting of the Styrofoam liner was visible.
 
The rider said that he had left his apartment and was on his way to a store. He stated that he had no specific memory of the crash. He had no idea what lane he was in or how fast he was going. When he spoke of OV1 making a left turn in front of him, it was because he had heard it from either the police or friends who had told him since the crash. When the rider spoke about the pre-ride safety check, he stated it was out of habit that he does it every time on the first ride of the day, not that he had any specific memory of doing it. He stated that prior to the crash, there were no issues or problems with MC1, the weather, visibility, the roadway or traffic conditions, family or friends, or anything that was distracting him. The 48 year old male (5?06?/200 lbs.) operator of OV1 participated over the phone for the interview. He stated that he was in California on vacation with his family. He stated that he was stopped in the northbound left turn lane long before the signal. He stated that there were no vehicles in front of him that he could remember. He wanted to make a turn into the drive-thru mini market. He said that he looked for on-coming vehicles and saw none. He started to make his left turn and then saw MC1 approaching very fast. He said that he accelerated to try and get out of the way when he felt an impact to the right rear of his vehicle. He said that he stopped as quickly as he could, which was in the driveway area. He stated that he had seven passengers in his vehicle and that two of them sustained minor injuries. There were no pre-impact tire marks from either vehicle. OV1 had been moved slightly prior to the arrival of the police. MC1 and the rider were at their FRPs. The silver Nissan pick-up seen in some of the photographs just south of MC1 was legally parked at the time of the crash and not involved. Several witnesses said that they had seen MC1 prior to the crash or at the time of the crash and estimated its speed to be anywhere from 50 mph to 90 mph, but definitely exceeding the speed limit. One witness stated that she was southbound stopping for a red light when MC1 passed her on the right. MC1 made a right turn at the intersection and then immediately made a left U-turn followed by a right turn and continued southbound. This behavior displays some aggressive riding habits. One witness saw MC1 changing lanes to the right at or near the intersection just before the crash.	He stated that he was wondering why since there were no obstructions in that area. He then saw OV1 turning left south of the intersection and surmised that the rider had seen this too and changed lanes in an effort
to avoid a crash. This indicates that that the rider saw OV1 and made an evasive maneuver. His decision to move to the right and not brake was incorrect. MC1 sustained major front end damage as a result of the crash. The forks and frame were broken. A small piece of the frame was found embedded in the side of OV1. The frame also bowed outward in the middle over the engine. No static measurement of the wheelbase could be done due to the damage. It was obvious that the front end had been pushed rearward into the radiator and engine area. It appears that the lacerations to the rider?s body occurred when he was ejected and flew over the rear of OV1 which had sharp deformed sheet metal as a result of the impact. The other injuries sustained were caused by blunt force trauma that would include the vehicle side and the ground.","The 25 year old male operator of MC1 sustained major injuries consisting of a skull fracture with a brain hemorrhage, lacerations to his liver and spleen, and a bruised kidney. He also had fractures to the thoracic vertebrae (T2), and his right wrist. He also sustained numerous lacerations which included his neck and the carotid artery, his left shoulder, right arm, and abdomen. He stated that he lost approximately 5 pints of blood. The rider was taken to a local hospital where he was admitted for 10 days. The rider displayed no signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle. The rider stated that he had smoked illegal marijuana the night before the crash.","The 48 year old male (5?06?/200 lbs.) operator of OV1 was not injured and displayed no signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle.	Two passengers sustained minor injuries.","The operator of MC1 had a decision failure in riding faster than the posted speed limit. He also had a reaction failure in swerving to the right instead of left and/or not braking.

The operator of OV1 had a perception failure in not seeing MC1 approaching, possibly because of MC1?s high speed.","MC1 sustained major damage to the front fork area. There was a maximum reduction in wheelbase as the forks were forced rearward into the engine area as MC1 impacted OV1 causing damage to the radiator and exhaust. The impact also fractured the frame at the yoke separating the forks from the rest of the bike and bent the side portions of the frame outward. The front rim was bent, but the tire still held pressure. The rear tire lost all pressure during the crash. The pre-crash condition of MC1 would be considered good to fair.

OV1 sustained major damage to the right rear side. There was significant intrusion into the passenger area. The right rear window and rear hatch window were broken. The rear hatch was crumpled and misaligned. A broken piece of the frame from MC1 was imbedded into the metal side panel of OV1.",There were no permanent or temporary environmental factors that would be considered contributory to this crash.

This crash occurred on a four lane roadway that is divided by a curb high center median that is 17? wide and has several trees and other greenery. The roadway was straight before leading into the gentle left curve. No parking is allowed on the roadway. The crown was measured to be 4.8% and the grade at - 2.9%. The roadway is made of an asphalt composition, is worn and polished, but in otherwise good condition. The roadway has standard concrete curbs. In the rider's direction there is a rural wilderness with an asphalt bike trail on the right and an apartment complex on the left. The bike trail is approximately 10? lower elevation than the roadway. The distance between the bike trail and the roadway varies. In the area of the crash, the distance varies from approximately 20? to 30?. Between the roadway and bike trail are several mature eucalyptus trees.	Just to the right of the roadway are several metal reflector signs that are approximately 36? tall. On the left side of the roadway is a meandering concrete sidewalk that sometimes meets the curb. Otherwise, there is grass adjacent to the roadway. The roadway has an east/west designation. At the crash site the roadway is a southwest/northeast orientation. The rider was headed southwest at 255 degrees at the crash location. The posted speed limit is 55 mph. The weather was listed as cloudy/partly cloudy with a light wind from the SSW. The temperature was +71 degrees. The crash took place in September 2015 in Southern California on a Tuesday at 1800 hrs. There was no construction in the area of the crash. The rider was part of a group of five riders. Other than the riders in the group, there was no other traffic at the time of the crash. MC1 was towed.

MC1 was a 2007 Harley Davidson (1584cc) cruising type motorcycle with modifications which included the exhaust, and handlebars. The 25 year old male (5? 09?/175 lbs.) rider was wearing a Simpson ?Street Bandit? full face helmet with integral chin bar and clear face shield. The helmet was matte black in color. The helmet had markings that indicated it met FMVSS 218 (US DOT) and Snell M2015 safety standards. He was wearing a thin cotton short sleeved shirt, regular denim jeans, below the ankle tennis type shoes and no gloves.

The rider was part of a group of five riders. The first four were riding in pairs, side by side. The fifth rider was riding to the right side of the lane behind them. The crash rider was reportedly riding in the middle on the right side. They all had just left a bar in which they stated that no one had been drinking and that they
 
were on their way to another unknown bar. All the riders were originally in the #1 (left) lane at a constant speed of a stated 50 mph. The first two riders changed lanes to the right, followed by the next two, and then the last rider. The last rider stated that he saw MC1 drift to the right and his front wheel was ?shuttering.? MC1 then brushed up against the right asphalt curb. It continued straight and then went into a storm drain opening. The storm drain deviation in the curb line opens to the right of the roadway approximately 5?. MC1 went into this opening and impacted the west portion of the storm drain which is at a 90 degree angle to the curb line. It does not jut out into the roadway. Upon impacting the curb, MC1's front rim was severely deformed and the front tire lost all air pressure. MC1 continued forward, and the under carriage/frame of MC1 scrapped over the top of the curb. MC1 continued in a westerly direction and impacted two 36? reflector road signs. Both signs were bent to nearly a 90 degree angle and the reflector portion was broken off. MC1 continued in a westbound direction hitting several objects before coming to its FRP. The rider was fully ejected. His helmet sustained major damage, including a fracture through the full thickness of the shell in the chin bar area on the left side. A portion of the chin bar is missing. It is unknown if the damage was caused by impacting one of the several trees on the roadside or some other object. When the police arrived, MC1 was found resting in a partially upright position, reportedly on its side stand, in the dirt south of bike trail below the roadway grade. In the on-scene photos, MC1 can be seen leaning against a dirt embankment. The side stand is not visible. It is unknown how much MC1 was moved prior to the arrival of the police. After impacting the curb and two road signs, MC1 tumbled end over end and flipped side over side to its FRP. Several parts of MC1 broke off and were found at the scene. There were no pre-impact skid marks. The rider?s FRP was not documented because he had been taken from the scene by the paramedics. In looking at the scene photos, it would appear that the rider?s FRP was not far from MC1 as bloody clothing and paramedic trash can be seen in the background. The rider was taken to a hospital where he was admitted. When MC1 was inspected, damage was located on all sides. In a brief interview of the rider at the hospital by the police, the rider stated that he had no memory of the crash. He stated that he had not consumed any alcohol or taken any drugs. The rider stated that he has been riding for between 12-15 years. He also stated that his MC is well maintained and had no mechanical issues. Witnesses not part of the group saw the group leaving the bar and stated that they were going very fast. Another witness came upon the crash after it occurred and found the rider?s friends removing objects from the rider?s pockets. He did not know what was being removed. While at the hospital, the rider submitted to a blood test to determine if he was DUI. The test results came back with a BAC of 0.01% alcohol and positive for Lidocaine. It is believed by the police that the Lidocaine might have been introduced to the rider?s system at the hospital rather than having been used as an illegal drug, but it is not certain. In the police accident report, the rider is listed on page #2
as ?HBD-Not Under Influence.?","The 25 year old male operator of MC1 sustained major injuries listed in the police accident report as consisting of fractures to his right tibia, fibula, and ankle. He also sustained a fractured T-7 in his spine along with nerve damage to his right arm. The rider sustained internal injuries consisting of a pneumothorax to his right lung and contused ribs. There was also listed a major laceration starting in the rider?s neck area and terminating in the chest area. The rider was taken to a local hospital where he was admitted for an unknown number of days. The rider apparently displayed some signs of intoxication or impairment that would inhibit his ability to operate a motor vehicle, however, he was deemed not under the influence. He was admitted to a local hospital for an unknown number of days.",,The operator of MC1 had a perception failure in not seeing the left curve in the roadway.,"MC1 sustained major damage to all sides.
